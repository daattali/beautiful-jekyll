**The Jamie Smith Field Course Award** will be awarded in the spring of 2016. 
Jamie Smith taught at UBC for 32 years and was one of the first faculty members to teach the Zoology field course (now called Biology 409) as well as several other field and research focused courses for undergraduate and graduate students. Attending a field course in Virginia when he was an undergraduate at the University of Edinburgh was a very valued experience for him, and he was a devoted field ecologist.

This $1600 award was established following his death in 2005 and will be given to a student who is attending a summer field course, such as Biology 409.

_**To apply for the award submit**_

* A current curriculum vitae ("CV", or academic resumé)
* A one to two page statement on why you want to take the field course.

Complete applications should be submitted to the Biology program coordinator at the Biological Science building 2521 or by email to tromba@zoology.ubc.ca by **April 15th 2016**.
