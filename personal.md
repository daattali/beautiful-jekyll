<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-user about-icon"></span>
I'm a series of spacetime events called Ricardo (or Richard). 
I was born in Florida to Cuban and Argentine parents (español es mi lengua materna). 
I'm a high tech low-life, an outdoorsy great indoorsman; voice-activated, user-friendly, self-cleaning, and compostable. 
I'm a non-believer and an overachiever, laid-back but forward-thinking, a supercharged subversive, a hands-on footloose.

For work, I use machine learning to fight climate change by scaling ecosystem restoration using drones. <a href="/work">Read more here</a>.

## Travel

- I have been to 28 countries so far. I've done 3 major bicycle tours (from Seattle to San Francisco, around Taiwan, and
  around New Zealand). I've been to 47 of 50 U.S. states.
- I've hitchhiked over 10,000 miles in the US, Taiwan, Thailand, Australia, and New Zealand.
- I converted a jumbo news crew van into a tiny home. It has roof-top solar, a fridge/freezer, and fits everything I
  own!

## Volunteering, Activism, Organizing

- I helped organize a Surveillance Self-Defense Workshop for Activists with TA3M Seattle.
- I organized and led a protest against Congress's plans to end the Internet's decentralized nature. Downtown Seattle,
  December 2014.
- I spent a month and a half volunteering full-time on Mota Lava, Vanuatu. I was helping communities be more resilient
  by teaching them to make virgin coconut oil and facilitating business deals. I gave various lectures at the local
  school and helped get paint for the local church.
- I've volunteered on various organic farms and intentional communities, including
  the [Awaawaroa Bay Eco Village](https://www.facebook.com/awaawaroabay)
  and [Wilderland Trust](https://www.facebook.com/WilderlandTrust/), and various other WWOOF and HelpX hosts.
- I was a full-time volunteer for a community science project monitoring how the world's largest LPG processing center
  would affect the world's largest Humpback whale calving area near James Price Point, Australia.
- I've been part of the [Couchsurfing](couchsurfing.org) community since
  2011 ([profile](https://www.couchsurfing.com/people/rovingrichard)).
- I have been a Wikipedia editor since 2008 ([profile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Richard.decal)).

## Talks and Interviews

- Ray Summit '21: 
  ["How Ray and Anyscale Make it Easy to do Massive-scale ML on Aerial Imagery"](https://raysummit.anyscale.com/content/Videos/dJRSr3NJLSP4h9CT8)
- Talk for TA3M Seattle: "How AI can be abused by surveillance
  states" ([presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lfn3T7R-ufjbzfmlVSMgAIyjC6hYhTTC41LMleQNFcQ/edit?usp=sharing))
- Interview with KOMO news in Seattle over the net neutrality debate
- Interview

## Art

- I was Artist in Residence at the [Sir James Wallace Arts Trust](www.wallaceartstrust.org.nz) for a few months in 2015.
  A selection of my works are in circulation around public spaces in New Zealand. Links to my Flickr below!
- I find the intersection of art and machine learning fascinating.
  I [maintain a repository](https://github.com/crypdick/awesome-neural-art) of research projects.

## Neckbeardery

- **Cloud server** - I run various services: nextcloud, Plex, seedbox with Lidarr/Radarr/Sonarr/etc., and a Tor node.
- **[Mobile library](https://github.com/PirateBox-Dev/PirateBox-Mesh)** - I converted a Raspberry Pi into an awesome
  mobile filesharing mesh network.
- **Personal Assistant** - I also converted a Raspberry Pi into a fully open-source digital assistant using Mycroft.ai.
- **Road warrior** - I am in constant persuit of the ultimate boondocking mobile workstation. At the moment, I converted
  a VR headset into a head mounted display which I tether to cellular internet. I look forward to getting a CTRL Labs
  dev kit or get a NeuralLink.
