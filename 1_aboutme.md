I am Rakesh Singh, also known as Raki, and I have been fortunate to acquire profound Ayurvedic knowledge under the guidance of renowned experts like Dr. GADGIL DILIP PRABHAKAR. With over 10 years of experience, I focus on **autoimmune disorders** and **cancer**, offering personalized treatment plans that address root causes of health issues. 

As an Ayurvedic health consultant, I empower clients to take control of their health through natural methods, helping them achieve **freedom** from medications and health supplements. Through Ayurvedic treatments, dietary recommendations, and lifestyle changes, I guide clients on a path to healing and wellness.

Discover holistic wellness through Ayurveda, yoga, and meditation, embracing natural remedies, herbal supplements, and super foods for stress relief, weight management, and overall health, while exploring mindfulness, organic living, and traditional Indian vedic medicine to achieve balance in mind, body, and spirit.
