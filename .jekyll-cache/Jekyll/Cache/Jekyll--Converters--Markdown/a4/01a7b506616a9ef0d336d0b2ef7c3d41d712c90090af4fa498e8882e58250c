<p><strong><em>Predicting NASDAQ movements using News</em></strong> <a href="https://github.com/anti-mony/NASDAQ-Movement-Prediction"><i class="fab fa-github"></i></a><br />
I did this project very recently from July-August 2019, where I tried to predict how the NASDAQ Composite index moves based on the news that comes in daily. I’m actually going to make a post about this one, there’s so muc to talk about here.<br />
<em>TLDR: I used RNNs to summarize text and used it to predict movements of the index.</em></p>
