<p><strong><em>Predicting NASDAQ Composite movements using News</em></strong> <a href="https://github.com/anti-mony/NASDAQ-Movement-Prediction"><i class="fab fa-github"></i></a><br />
I did this project very recently from July-August 2019, where I tried to predict how the NASDAQ Composite index moves based on the news that comes in daily, here is a blog for this. I’m actually going to make a post about this one, there’s so much to talk about here.
<em><strong>TLDR</strong>: I used RNNs to summarize text and used it to predict movements of the index, I gathered data from sources online, cleaned and pre-processed it using NLTK and the deep learning was done using PyTorch.</em></p>
