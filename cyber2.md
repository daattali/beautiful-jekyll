### Project title: How many shades of NIS? Understanding organisational cultures and sectoral differences during cyber security policy implementation

The project developed an empirically-grounded understanding of the role and impact of organisational cybersecurity cultures and practices across essential infrastructure sectors on the UK’s implementation of the NIS Regulations. We uncovered organisational and sectoral differences, for instance, in the ways which people work, what technologies (software/hardware) are relied upon, what additional compliance requirements exist. This yielded key insights about the NIS objectives that are already achieved, the ones difﬁcult to effectively realise and potential blind spots arising from organizational cultures and sectoral practices. 

*Project team*: Prof. Awais Rashid (PI), Dr Dirk van der Linden (Co-I), Dr Sveta Milyaeva (Co-I), Dr Ola Michalec (PDRA). We were funded by the Research Institute in Trustworthy Inter-connected Cyber-Physical Systems (RITICS).
