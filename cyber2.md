### Project title: How many shades of NIS? Understanding organisational cultures and sectoral differences during cyber security policy implementation

The project developed an empirically-grounded understanding of the role and impact of organisational cybersecurity cultures and practices across essential infrastructure sectors on the UK’s implementation of the Network and Information Systems (NIS) Regulations. We uncovered organisational and sectoral differences, for instance, in the ways which people work, what technologies (software/hardware) are relied upon, what additional compliance requirements exist. This yielded key insights about the NIS objectives that are already achieved, the ones difﬁcult to effectively realise and potential blind spots arising from organizational cultures and sectoral practices.

### Project title: What’s next for the NIS Directive? Extending the community of interest to better understand the Indicators of Good Practice

Since 2018, the European Union member states and the UK have been working on implementing the Network and Information Systems Security (NIS) Directive. The literature analysing the framing of NIS (e.g. Michels and Walden, 2018, and Wallis and Johnson, 2020) points at two main policy concerns: (i) the operators will fail to share or disclose information about cybersecurity measures and breaches and, as a result,  (ii) we will lack the understanding of co-dependencies (i.e. how security issues impact other areas of business). Our recent work through RITICS on NIS implementation (Michalec et al, 2020 and 2021) confirmed that both the goals of NIS and OT security issues are poorly understood outside of the narrow circle of experts. In particular, the Indicators of Good Practice (IGP) need further refining to better illustrate the progress in maturity.

This project contributed towards build a community of both cyber security experts and business leaders to enable translation between security and operational concerns and, as a result, make better decisions about cyber security in its broader organisational context. This fellowship drew a roadmap for an improved version of IGPs and cyber maturity assessments, highlighting.....
