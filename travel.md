### Trip to Greece
I studied abroad in Greece where I had the opportunity to work with Greek College Students and participate in the study of Business, Law, and Ethics. Over the span of 4 weeks, we were based in Athens, Syros, and Nafplion. I learned about the Greek economic system and how it compares to that in the United States, law and policy related to key business operations, and Greek history and culture. I was taught by professors from my home college as well as professors from the University of Athens and corporate representatives from companies like Coca-Cola. We hiked monuments, visited museums, and took cooking and dancing classes.
