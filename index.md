Hi there, I am Emil Dimanchev and I am a climate policy researcher. Follow my latest work on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EmilDimanchev).

## Research

My research investigates the effects of climate policies, the behavior of macro-energy systems, and how to design climate policies that best meet societal goals. My approach is interdisciplinary, with a focus on operations research, economics, and engineering.  

## PhD project

My PhD focuses on the impact of investor uncertainty and risk aversion on the clean energy transition and on how climate policies should account for investment risk. I am developing stochastic optimization models that address these questions in the contexts of power system planning and EV charging station investments. 

The pace of the clean energy transition is out of line with governments' climate change goals. The first [publication]([url](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9783527831425.ch8)) of my PhD investigates the extent to which passenger vehicles must be electrified for nations to reach 2C and 1.5C climate targets. Based on a meta-analysis of decarbonization pathways, we find that most vehicles must be zero-emission by 2050. Using fleet turnover modeling, we show that this requires an acceleration of electric vehicle sales and of the retirement of internal combustion engine vehicles. 

The second [publication](https://ceepr.mit.edu/workingpaper/accelerating-electric-vehicle-charging-investments-a-real-options-approach-to-policy-design/) of my PhD investigates how policy can accelerate investment in EV charging stations by accounting for the risks faced by private-sector investors using real options modeling. In my third project, I am exploring how power system decarbonization is impacted by investor uncertainty, risk aversion, and the incompleteness of risk markets. For this purpose I am developing new stochastic optimization and game theoretic equilibrium methods for modeling power system expansion under uncertainty.

## Bio

I am currently a PhD Candidate in electric power engineering at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology ([NTNU](https://www.ntnu.edu/iel/groups/emesp#/view/about)), a Research Affiliate at the MIT [Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research](https://ceepr.mit.edu/people/dimanchev-emil/), and a Superforecaster at [Good Judgment](https://goodjudgment.com). 

In previous roles, I was a Senior Research Associate at MIT CEEPR, and prior to that I worked as a Senior Carbon Market Analyst at Thomson Reuters Point Carbon.

I have testified before legislators and advised government officials on climate policy in the U.S. and the European Union. I advised Members of the European Parliament and member state officials on the reform of the European Emissions Trading System. My work was featured in EU Parliament and European Commission hearings, "contributing to a cool-headed debate" in the words of one policy maker. My research has also been quoted in the media including Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal, Politico, BBC, and others.

I hold a M.Sc. from MIT's Technology and Policy Program and a B.A. in mathematical economics from Colorado College.

Aside from my work, I enjoy books, climbing, and cross-country skiing.
