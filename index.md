Hi there, I am Emil Dimanchev and I am a climate policy researcher specializing in energy systems, policy design, and techno-economic modeling.

## Research

The purpose of my work is to enable evidence-based decision making. I research sustainable energy systems, the effects of alternative policy choices, and how to design climate policy that best meets societal goals. 

My research is interdisciplinary, leveraging diverse methods matched to the problem at hand. I specialize in systems engineering and operations research, and integrate tools and insights from other disciplines including economics, data science, and political science. 

My PhD work is on strategies and policies for simultaneous electricity decarbonization and transport electrification. I am working on methods for electricity system planning to address questions related to charging infrastructure investments, generation planning, and the role of electric vehicles in decarbonized power systems.

## Bio

I am currently a PhD Candidate in electric power engineering at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), a Research Affiliate at the MIT [Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research](http://ceepr.mit.edu), and a Superforecaster at [Good Judgment](https://goodjudgment.com).

Previously, I worked as a Senior Research Associate at MIT CEEPR, and a Senior Carbon Market Analyst at Thomson Reuters Point Carbon.

I have testified before legislators on climate policy, served as a consultant to government officials on carbon pricing, and briefed senior staff at Fortune Global 500 companies. My work on the reform of the European Emissions Trading System was featured in the EU Parliament and the EU Commission, "contributing to a cool-headed debate" in the words of one policy maker. My research has also been quoted in the media including Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal, Politico, BBC, and others.

I hold a M.Sc. from MIT's Technology and Policy Program and a B.A. in mathematical economics from Colorado College.
