&gt;I don't get it, sir.

&lt;There's nothing to get, you just take orders.

&gt;But it makes no sense. &nbsp;How am I supposed to do all this?

&lt;Get help.

&lt;You've contacted them before. &nbsp;Get their attention the same way.

&gt;That was just a game

&lt;So is this\! &nbsp;Just a different type. &nbsp;There a reason I spent so much time and money to contact you back in 2014. &nbsp;When this thing started. &nbsp;Back when this began. &nbsp;Where you should look for your next clue. <!--HEY ARG PLAYERS IS THIS A GOOD ENOUGH HINT DO SOME RESEARCH AND GO ->>>>>DISCUSS<<<<<- THINGS-->

&gt;What the hell are you talking about?

&lt;CONNECTION ENDED&gt;
