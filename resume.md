# SUMMARY #
>>>>>>> fdaf2eaa003374991bdea2290f2cc10ddd7c2e6a
I have a diverse background in applications and networking.  I have always looked to grow and expand technology bases by focusing on the business problem and solving through technologies.  Over 20 years in technology was spent learning, developing and expanding many areas of technology.  I worked as a tactical problem solver in IT, to customer sales through to solutions architecture.  

Shifts in technology have driven greater interest in those technology growth phases such as the transition of voice from TDM, to ATM/Frame, and on to IP.  Next I focused on enabling the shift of video from traditional MPEG technologies to Adaptive bit rate technologies and scaling those environments leveraging CDN technologies.  Current focus area is on Data Center technologies; Cloud Management systems, SDN models, automation, orchestration forwarding plane performance, application dependency graphs.   These technologies all play back to network carrier's core business of networking and helping them monetize their network while reducing their operations cost.  

I love the chance to learn and educate.  Success for me is driving the technology decision that solves the business problems.  One product rarely solves the problem.  I enjoy driving a multi-product strategy to address customer needs.  I am very interested in driving change into these service providers as they adapt to new operational models.  Driving change and customer adoption of new technologies excites me.  

### Technology areas of interest ###

- **Server technology transformation** - Segment routing and MPLS is coming closer and closer to the host layer.
- **Network Analytics** - Playing a larger role, than every before; trends in security and application dependency tracing
- **Scaling VNFs** - new horizontal scaling with highly stateful workloads are very interesting.  Coupled with both the above there is a lot of power there
- **Automation & Orchestration** - This is the foundation upon all the above must be built upon in order for the goal of lowering operations expenditures and increased velocity to be realized.

Solutions definition with large multi-national carrier focused on transforming network and operating models around cloud and virtualization technologies.  Focused on infrastructure platforms such as OpenStack and Nuage for SDN.  Additionally, network and security analytics through Nokia's Deepfield.

#### Key successes ####

- drove need for overlay technologies to drive carrier's network automation model in the data center. Resulting in a multimillion dollar contract on product and paid development costs
- working with product teams to define ongoing product direction towards becoming a controller agnostic to the platforms supporting the overlay. Working with product teams to drive newer networking models to address forwarding quality across the network.
- multiple PS agreements for various delivery and consultative services for Nuage overlay networking.
- aid various mobility VNF teams and their movement to address the shift in cloud.

### Sr. Consulting Systems Engineer ###

Technical leadership in an account team focused on a large multinational network service provider’s data center infrastructure and SDN models.

#### Key successes ####

  • In response to the needs around cost reduction and better resource utilization in the data center, proposed a transformative overlay SDN solution.  In order to provide the right solution, worked with product teams and partner teams to determine and document a new data center architecture for the customer. Ultimately, resulting in the first install of OpenStack with Juniper’s Contrail Networking.
  • Many requirements were coming from different parts of the account for SDN. I worked across the technical team to define and document the functional high level design.  This enabled the team to have a common message to the customer reinforcing our SDN strategy and minimizing variance between teams.
  • Drove the creation of a whitebox strategy based on customer perception of the need to go towards a disaggregated white box model.
