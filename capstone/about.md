title: About the Capstone Course

---


During the last two months of the MDS program (mid April to late June each year), our students work in teams with an external capstone partner and a teaching fellow mentor to address a question facing the capstone partner's organization using data science. This page provides an overview of the MDS capstone project. You may also be interested in the [capstone proposal guidelines](./capstone/proposal), the [timeline and procedures](./captone/selection), and the [FAQ](./capstone/faq). 

## The Capstone Projects

The capstone projects that our students complete have the following characteristics:

- Pose an interesting and open-ended question/problem that can be addressed using data science for which data is available or obtainable.
- Pose a multi-faceted question/problem, containing enough dimensions to be addressed in a multitude of ways.
- Are sufficiently deep, such that a useful data product can be made in two months that makes a solid advance on the problem.
- Can be split up into milestones, such that concrete progress can be made in two months.
- Draw on various tools and topics the students have learned in their [courses](https://ubc-mds.github.io/descriptions/) during the MDS program.

The work involved in each capstone project, completed by a group of ~4 MDS students, must include

- refining the project's over-arching question into one that can be directly addressed using data science;
- using data science to draw useful information and recommendations from data; and
- making the information and recommendations accessible to the capstone partner through various effective means of communication (such as documentation, visuals, presentations, and reports).

What a capstone project is _not_:

- Setting up and/or maintaining a database.
    - This type of project does not focus on drawing useful information from data.
- A pre-specified approach, such as applying a particular machine learning algorithm to a particular data set
    - This type of project is too narrow, not open-ended, and has only one or a few solutions. We expect our students to creatively come up with their own data science approaches to address the capstone partner's over-arching question/problem (potentially with advice from the capstone partner on data science approaches).
- Data cleaning.
    - Although we expect some data wrangling to be involved in the project, we ask that you provide data that is mostly clean and "ready-to-go". If you need help with this, [ASDa](https://asda.stat.ubc.ca/) from the UBC Department of Statistics might be able to help for a fee.

## Course Milestones

Our students complete the following major milestones throughout the capstone course.

1. __Propose__ the data product and approach. (~__2 weeks__)
    1. Work with your team, colleagues, and teaching fellows to develop an approach in a 2-day hackathon.
    2. Present the proposal at UBC, to solicit ideas and feedback.
    3. Write the proposal. This will be passed to the capstone partner to check that the proposed product is indeed in line with the capstone partner's needs.
2. __Develop__ the data product (~__6 weeks__). This involves:
    - Regular meetings with the teaching fellow mentor.
    - Regular meetings with the capstone partner.
    - Recording your progress and explorations in a data science notebook.
3. __Polish__ the data product for delivery to your capstone partner (~__2 weeks__).
    1. Present your final data product and approach to the class.
    2. Deliver the data product after incorporating feedback from teaching fellows and colleagues, along with a final report.
    3. Briefly present your product(s) in an end-of-program celebration (not graded).
4. __Reflect__ on the project in a short individual report.

## Expectations

Here are our expectations of our students and capstone partners

### Student Expectations

We expect our student groups to

- communicate productively, identify sub-problems that could be worked on individually by team members, and integrate contributions of team members into a final product;
- work at least four full-time days per week on the project;
- document and present their work at UBC (using written, oral, and visual means) at various points throughout the course.
- optionally (but strongly recommended), present their final product and findings to the capstone partner's organization.

### Expectations of Capstone Partners

- You should be able to provide our students with ample data that is relevant to a question/problem faced by your organization. This need not belong to the capstone partner's organization -- for example, it could come freely online.
    - Datasets must be sufficiently clean, and an appropriate and size that the students will be able to load into R and/or Python in a reasonable amount of time and effort.

- The partner must be available to meet with MDS students working on the capstone project (in person ideally) every 1-2 weeks during the two months students are working on the capstone project.

- The partner is expected to be present (in person or remotely) for the students' final presentation of the capstone project (whether at UBC or at your organization).

- The partner must come to an agreement about data and product sharing, licensing and intellectual product rights. The MDS program will support agreements that benefit both the students and the partners. Please note that it will be key for the students to share some aspect of the project in their portfolios/curriculum vitae during their job search following graduation from the MDS program.

- Preference will be given to organizations located in Canada, and especially in the Vancouver area.

### Benefits to Capstone Partners

- An opportunity to get to know and work with ~4 data scientists-in-training working on your dataset/project for ~2 months, at no cost, who could be potential future employees. These students will be well versed in modern data science tools and techniques, including statistical analysis and visualizations using R and Python.

- A well-developed product of interest/relevance to your work (*e.g.,* Shiny app, analytic report, scripts/software). This product is expected to be of high quality, with excellent code documentation and testing.

- An opportunity to develop a relationship with the UBC MDS program. These relationships have the possibility of kickstarting research collaborations between the partners and UBC.
