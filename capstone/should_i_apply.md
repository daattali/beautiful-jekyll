title: Should I Apply to be a Capstone Partner?

---

- You should be able to provide our students with ample data that is relevant to a question/problem faced by your organization. This need not belong to the capstone partner's organization -- for example, it could come freely online.


- Datasets must be checked and vetted by [MDS](https://ubc-mds.github.io/) and/or [Applied Statistics and Data Science Group](http://asda.stat.ubc.ca/) (ASDa) staff to ensure that they are of sufficient cleanliness and size that the students will be able to load the datasets into R and/or Python in a reasonable amount of time and effort. Depending on the size of the dataset and/or the amount of work, the Partner may have to pay MDS and/or ASDA staff for dataset checking and vetting.

- The partner must be available to meet with MDS instructional staff to discuss the project and develop 1-2 potential projects. Datasets and potential project risks must be identified. This must be done well in advance of the beginning of the Capstone projects in April.

- The partner must be available to meet with MDS students working on the capstone project (in person or remotely) 2-4 times during the two months (April & May) students are working on the capstone project.

- The partner is expected to review and comment on the utility and quality of the final product produced by the students after completion of the project.

- The partner is expected to be present (in person or remotely) for the students' final presentation of the capstone project.

- The partner must come to an agreement about Data and product sharing, licensing and intellectual product rights. The MDS program will support agreements that benefit both the students and the Partners. Please note that it will be key for the students to share some aspect of the project in their portfolios/curriculum vitae during their job search following graduation from the MDS program.

- Preference will be given to organizations located in Canada, and especially in the Vancouver area.

## What's in it for me?

- ~ 2 months of free (or low cost) data science work on a dataset/project.

- A well developed product of interest/relevance to their work (*e.g.,* Shiny app, analytic report, scripts/software). This product is expected to be of high quality, with excellent code documentation and testing.

- An opportunity to get to know ~ 4 MDS students who could represent potential future employees. These students will be well versed in modern data science tools and techniques, including statistical analysis and visualizations using R and Python.

- An opportunity to develop a relationship with the UBC MDS program, as well as ASDa. These relationships have the possibility of kickstarting research collaborations between the Partners and members of the Department of Statistics at UBC.
