Here are some things you can do to get involved with TX-10 Indivisible: 

### Read the Indivisible Guide

Before you do anything else, please read [The Indivisible
Guide](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/download-the-guide). That's
the playbook we're following. It presents a specific strategy designed
especially for us to resist the bad policies we expect from Trump and
his supporters.

### Join our Facebook Group

If you're a Facebook user, you can join the [TX-10 Indivisible Facebook
Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/381205945554014/), where we post our
announcements and "call to action" notices. We also share selected
links of interest. It's a closed group, and you can request access from the above-linked page. 

After you join the Facebook group, be sure to click "Notifications"
in the page banner and select "All Posts". Otherwise you'll miss our
announcements. The group volume is low so you won't be flooded.

### Follow us on Twitter

If you're a Twitter user, follow [@TX10Indivisible](https://twitter.com/TX10Indivisible).

Please retweet and comment as appropriate and help amplify our social media message.

### Take Action!

Follow our announcements and take action. Our announcements are posted
to the Facebook group, on Twitter, and on our website.

And always feel empowered to take action on your own. If you join our
Slack discussion forum (below) you can share your ideas and connect with
other motivated activists.

### Get Slack

We organize our work through an online message system called Slack.
If you want to help us with planning and organizing, [contact our admin
