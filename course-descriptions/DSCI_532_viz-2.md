# DSCI 532: Data Visualization II

## Short Description
Analysis, design, and implementation of interactive figures. How to provide multiple views, deal with complexity, and make difficult decisions about data reduction.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students are expected to be able to:

1. Analyze interactive visualizations in terms of: dynamic change over time, partitioning into multiple views, and data reduction within a single view.
2. Design new interactive visualizations for complex datasets where a single static view is not sufficient for the intended analysis task.
3. Implement interactive visualizations using existing toolkits and libraries.
4. Explain the trade-offs of using 3D vs 2D representations and of using animation vs juxtaposed views.
5. Explain and justify methods to validate visualization design effectiveness including computational benchmarks, field studies on deployed software, and qualitative discussion of visual results.
