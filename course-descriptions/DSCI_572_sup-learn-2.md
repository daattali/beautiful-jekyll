## Short Description
How to combine models via ensembling: boosting, bagging, random forests. Neural networks and deep learning: state-of-the-art implementation considerations in both software and hardware.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students are expected to be able to:

1. Apply various schemes to ensemble multiple classifiers to boost performance.
2. Demonstrate how various decision trees can be combined into a random forest classifier, and explain the role of bagging in such classifiers.
3. Train neural networks for performing regression and classification tasks with deep learning.
4. Deploy neural networks on a GPU.
