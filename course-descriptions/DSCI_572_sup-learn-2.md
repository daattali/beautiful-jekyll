## Short Description
An introduction to optimization for machine learning. Computation of derivatives. Deep learning.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students are expected to be able to:

1. Formulate various machine learning problems as optimization problems.
2. Implement gradient descent and compare/contrast with stochastic gradient descent.
3. Avoid common numerical errors due to rounding error. 
4. Compare/contrast different ways of computing derivatives (symbolic/automatic/numerical differentiation).
5. Train neural networks for performing regression and classification tasks with deep learning.
6. Deploy neural networks on a GPU.
