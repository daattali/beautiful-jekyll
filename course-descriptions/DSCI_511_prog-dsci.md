## Short Description
Overview of data structures, iteration, flow control, and program design relevant to data exploration and analysis. When and how to exploit pre-existing libraries.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students are expected to be able to:

1. Write pseudo-code to specify, break down, and solve problems before being translated into code.
2. Write modular, easy-to-understand Python and R code that uses flow control, iteration, lists (arrays), and functions--and has appropriate style and organization.
3. Design and write Python and R programs to: perform calculations; read and write files; and use classes, objects, methods, and Python and R libraries.
Determine which language (Python or R) is more appropriate for a given task.
