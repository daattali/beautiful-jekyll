<p>I’m Fei, a Principal Scientist at <a href="https://lila.ai/">Lila Sciences</a>, where I use machine learning to design proteins, mRNA, and DNA regulatory elements for therapeutics.</p>

<p>I earned my PhD in Physics from the <a href="https://nbi.ku.dk/english/">Niels Bohr Institute</a> at the University of Copenhagen, developing computational methods to study protein structure and dynamics. My work combined dynamic Bayesian networks and Monte Carlo simulations to model protein dynamics [Ref 1]. I also accurately predicted the structure of an amyloid protein by decoding evolutionary patterns in protein sequences [Ref 2], 5 years before AlphaFold’s release.</p>

<p>During my postdoc with <a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/about-niddk/staff-directory/biography/best-robert">Robert Best</a> at the NIH, we discovered that generative models capturing covariant patterns within a protein family can be used effectively to design novel protein sequences. We published (arguably) the first study applying a generative model to create high-diversity protein sequences, validated through wet-lab experiments [Ref 3], followed by a subsequent study on a larger protein [Ref 4]. In addition to protein design, I also developed molecular simulation methods that explain how proteins fold on the ribosome [Ref 5–8]. </p>

<p>Afterwards, at <a href="https://www.novozymes.com/en">Novoyzmes A/S</a>, I applied my research and designed several enzymes products for the global market, including <a href="https://www.novozymes.com/en/solutions/laundry/freshness">Pristine®</a>, <a href="https://www.novozymes.com/en/campaigns/novozymes-carezyme-elite">Carezyme®</a> and <a href="https://www.novozymes.com/en/solutions/laundry/gum-stains">Mannaway®</a> etc. </p>
