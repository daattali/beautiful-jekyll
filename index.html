<h2>modus operandi</h2>
I am a maker. I help people make better decisions by designing technologies that connect people to what they want to do. I seek to learn about and to connect people with technologies that positively influence our mind, body, and relationships. I recently moved back to the bay. I'm an avid traveler and can be found hiking, wood working, and running.
