<p>I’m Fei, a Principal Scientist at <a href="https://lila.ai/">Lila Sciences</a>, where I develop machine learning methods to design proteins, mRNA, and DNA regulatory elements for therapeutic applications.</p>

<p>I got my PhD in Physics from the <a href="https://nbi.ku.dk/english/">Niels Bohr Institute</a> at the University of Copenhagen, advised by <a href="https://www1.bio.ku.dk/english/research/bms/sbinlab/kll/">Kresten Lindorff-Larsen</a>, <a href="https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/persons/wouter-boomsma"> Wouter Boomsma</a>, <a href="https://www.nbi.dk/~mhjensen/">Mogens Høgh Jensen</a> and <a href="https://inano.au.dk/about/research-groups/otzenlab/daniel-erik-otzen">Daniel Otzen</a>, where I developed computational methods to predict protein structure and dynamics. My work combined dynamic Bayesian networks and Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations to capture protein conformational fluctuations [Ref 1]. I also accurately predicted the structure of an amyloid protein by decoding evolutionary patterns in protein sequences [Ref 2], 5 years before AlphaFold’s release.</p>

<p>During my postdoc with <a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/about-niddk/staff-directory/biography/best-robert">Robert Best</a> at the NIH, we discovered that generative model capturing covariant patterns within a protein family can be used effectively to design novel protein sequences. In 2018, we published (arguably) the first study applying a generative model to create high-diversity protein sequences, validated through wet-lab experiments [Ref 3], followed by a subsequent study on a larger protein [Ref 4]. In addition to protein design, I also developed molecular dynamics simulation methods that explain how proteins fold on the ribosome [Ref 5–8]. </p>

<p>Afterwards, at <a href="https://www.novozymes.com/en">Novoyzmes A/S R&D</a>, I applied my research to design several enzyme products for the global market, including <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/09/15/2297177/0/en/New-enzyme-expands-the-role-of-biological-ingredients-for-laundry-detergents.html">Pristine®</a>, <a href="https://biosolutions.tv/video/84582993/carezyme-elite-mode-of-action">Carezyme®</a>, <a href="https://www.novozymes.com/en/solutions/laundry/gum-stains">Mannaway®</a>, and others. </p>
