We are residents of the [Texas 10th Congressional District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas%27s_10th_congressional_district),
represented by [Rep.  Michael McCaul](http://mccaul.house.gov/), and we oppose the radical Trump agenda.

We believe The Indivisible Guide offers a valuable playbook to reduce the damage
that Trump and the conservative Congress might do over the next several years.

We are actively working to stop their radical agenda.

Please join us if you share that goal.
