My name is Alex Leu, and this is what I do!:

- I've recently started working in the Optimization Lab team at AdRoll, Inc as a
  Data Scientist
- I've recently developed an interest in shiny, and R markdown.
- I also like to run. 
- I like to play guitar, beatbox, and sing!

### my interest
I am a natural science life long learner who had recently discovered the beauty
of computer science. I started coding on my first job in sales operation,
thinking many day to day tasks can be automated with programming, and the
ultimate result of automation leads me to the world of computational statistic,
data science.

Having to have this picture in mind, I was intrigued by this challenge to create
this ideal world into reality. I started off writing scripts and apps that
improve my own work efficiency, and later leads to codes that improves the whole
entire team's day to day job. As I move in from the operational side into the BI
side, I am even more fascinated by how data science can be utilizes to impact
business models.

My passion is to create and optimizes data algorithm that not only replace
manual nodes with intelligent data driven quality, but also drives up the full
data stream to make the best business executive decisions.

### my history

I graduated from UCLA back in 2014 in Biophysics.

I worked as a contractor at Google back in 2014-2016 as a Business Intelligence
Devleoper.
