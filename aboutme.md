I'm a research scientist specializing in the application of computational science and machine learning to ecological and evolutionary questions. My work includes developing computer vision models to predict zoonotic reservoir host distribution, enhancing wildlife disease surveillance through natural language processing, and mitigating viral spillover using predictive forecasting. I'm dedicated to open and reproducible science, and to accurately capturing uncertainty in modeling. Outside of my research, I enjoy hiking, camping in the Pacific Northwest, and spending quality time with my family.
