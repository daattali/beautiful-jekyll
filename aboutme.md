### About me  
Something I love about blogs is that they can save lives (like telling you to read the warning message when you change IPv6 on ESXi). However I didn't create this blog to become a lifeguard but I wanted to share the interesting things I learn in my job, the problems I encounter and how I solved them. Or even just the new cool things that I think deserve to be more popular. It is as well a great opportunity for me to dig deeper into the topics I write about and to have a place to store my learnings (no more .txt file containing that awesome powershell command that I lost emptying my USB key).

My name is Xavier Avrillier, I am a frenchman living in Scotland where I work as a technical engineer in a managed services department, so if my english doesn't make sense this is why!
In my previous professional positions I worked as a Windows administrator for SMBs and as a pre-sales engineer for an IT company for 2 years, where I learned a great deal about a wide range of products and technologies. My current position is mainly focused on managing the VMware infrastructure of the company but I assist my colleagues in Windows world as well. Working with my "PowerShell guru" colleague got me really into scripting and PowerCLI which is so powerful so there will probably be quite a lot of it in this blog.

I hope you wee chappies will find some interesting articles and learn some stuff, Cheers!
