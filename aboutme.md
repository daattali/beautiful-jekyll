<i class="fas fa-user-graduate">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Enrolled in the Masters Program in Computer Science (*Data Analytics Track*) at the University of Chicago.

<i class="fas fa-history">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>I grew up in New Delhi, India, Hindi is my native language and I got my first computer when I was in 1st grade.
