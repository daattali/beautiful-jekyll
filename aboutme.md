subtitle: Why chem and code?

My name is Alona Varshal. I'm a chemist learning to code. I got started in Python in 2016, but I did have some experience creating websites from scratch (back in the 90s) using Notepad. I can use pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, Seaborn, and other data analysis package in Python.

My chemistry background includes organic chemistry, biochemistry and analytical chemistry. I did research on dendrimers as systems for drug delivery, enzyme inhibition,
and chemical array sensing. The former area spurred me to pursue data science as it involved pattern recognition. I applied principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to classify different test mixtures (wines) using chemically synthesized array sensors.
