### My background

Myself Baltej Giri and I am born and raise in Northern India. Right after completing High School, I moved to New Zealand to pursue higher education. I and my wife both migrated to Canada in 2016 and landed in beautiful community called Okanagan Valley in British Columbia. Here I would like to welcome you on my portfolio where I showcase my unique journey to be a Computer Networking Expert.

I am enthusiastic about all things regarding computers and networks. I have five years of experience in Information Technology with excellent communication skills.

Cisco Systems is my choice of vendor to follow their curriculum to assess my knowledge through their certifications. Currently mastering skills for Cisco Certifie Network Associate exam using official Cert Guide from Wendell Odom and hands on practice with Cisco Packet Tracer and Eve-ng. My roadmap is to certified in Enterprise networking at professional and expert level using Cisco certification track.

I am a big advocate for Open Source, I use Linux based Operating Systems, Applications and software’s to home lab or run home network solution like pfSense for firewall, Raspberry Pi (pi-hole OS) for DNS and so on.

Idea to have this blog post, to store the documentations of home labs and journey through it. Once again, I thank you for taking time to be here and I stay connected with me I am always available on Networking Community called The Art of Network Engineering through their discord group.

Over the next few weeks I will be finishing a portfolio github page website using a template. Trust me, this is a very first steps for me to dig into some web development side. So stay tuned!
