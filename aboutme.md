### My Life
Working towards a BS in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County with a minor in Math

I think AI is cool, so I've been experimenting with it in my spare time. 
See my projects <a href="cqdinh.github.io/projects#AI">Here</a>

I've fallen in love with martial arts over the 12 years that I've been practicing Tae Kwon Do with parts of other styles thrown in.

### Work Experience
My last three summers have been spent interning at MantaroBot where I worked on various aspects of their telepresence robots.

This past summer, I tested a system using IR communication and Arduino to implement automatic docking. In addition, I created an algorithm to model and optimize the movement of a robot arm. This algorithm used forward and inverse kinematics with gradient descent techniques in order to minimize the stress on the arm’s joints.

The summer before that, I worked on a system for automatic wall detection and avoidance using a Raspberry Pi and a depth sensor that acted like a very low-resolution LIDAR. I prototyped the algorithm in Octave and then finalized it in Python using NumPy and MatPlotLib to analyze and visualize the data as well as to create a simulated test environment.

My first summer at MantaroBot, I implemented additional communication pathways for the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mantaro.telemerobotappv3">MantaroBot TeleMe Robot App</a> and <a href="http://www.mantarobot.com/telego/">MantaroBot TeleGo Controller</a> to use.
