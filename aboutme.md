### About me  
Something I love about blogs is that they can save lives (like telling you to read the warning message when you change IPv6 on ESXi). However I didn’t create this blog with this pretention but I wanted to share the interesting things I learn in my job, the problems I encounter and how I solved them. Or even just the new cool things that I think deserve to be more popular. It is as well a great opportunity for me to dig deeper into the topics I write about and to have a place to store my learnings (no more .txt file containing that awesome powershell command that I lost emptying my USB key).

My name is **Xavier Avrillier**, I am a french technical engineer living in Scotland where I work for a british company in the managed services department. My current position is mainly focused on managing the VMware infrastructure of the company but I assist my colleagues in Windows world as well. Working with my “PowerShell guru” colleague got me really into scripting and PowerCLI so there will probably be quite a lot of it in this blog.

I am passionate in new technologies in general but my heart goes to virtualization which I am really interested in and is for me the base of every growing IT technologies today like containers, clouds, SDS, SDN, ...
As well as working in virtualization I study for VMware professional certifications and run labs at home to discover new features, products and possibilities for potential implementation in my professional environment or just for my personal knowledge.

In my previous professional positions I worked as a Windows administrator for SMBs and as a pre-sales engineer for an IT company for 2 years, where I learned a great deal about a wide range of products and technologies, which makes me polyvalent and a quick learner. 

I hope you find some interesting articles in this blog and learn some stuff, Cheers!
