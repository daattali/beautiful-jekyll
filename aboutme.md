### Welcome to Cloud Babble- a personal blog site focussing on Google Cloud! 

I'm Jamie Thompson, a Senior Cloud Architect specializing in Google Cloud at Atos, with 20 years experience in a variety of roles including operations, project delivery, design, governance, migration and leadership across:

- Public Cloud- GCP
- Private Cloud- VMware vSphere
- Wintel
- MS Active Directory
- PKI
- Infrastructure
- Networks

During this time I have worked across a diverse range of industries including public sector, nuclear, defence, FS&I, utilities, education, health, and an assortment of SMB’s with both large global systems integrators and smaller IT organisations. I’ve spent a lot of time working in heavily regulated, secure industries, designing cloud platforms and migrating 100’s of applications comprising of rehost, replatform and rearchitect migrations,
I started working with Google Cloud in 2019 and embarked upon various certifications (and recertifications!) along the way including:

- Google Cloud Professional Data Engineer
- Google Cloud Professional Architect
- Google Cloud Professional Developer
- Google Cloud Professional DevOps Engineer
- Google Cloud Professional Network Engineer
- Google Cloud Professional Security Engineer
- Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer
- Google Cloud Cloud Digital Leader

In addition to my role as a Cloud Architect, I also co-host our GCP Coaching Hub at Atos. This is a global community of Atos employees focussed on Google Cloud with the aim of supporting members with training, gaining certification, provide opportunities to gain hands on experience and benefit from other peoples knowledge and experience via regular webinars and events.

I’ve decided to create this blog to help share my knowledge and experience with Google Cloud, document best practices and hopefully help others who are studying towards GCP certifications or looking for some guidance on GCP products and services.
