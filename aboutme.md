### About me

The best thing about blogs is that people can share what they learn, talk from experiences or make tutorials so everyone increase their knowledge in the process. I have always read articles and How-To's, be it for my job or not and it helped me a lot. This blog is the opportunity for me to contribute and give back to the community. I consider it as being a mere brain dump of my IT journey.

I am passionate about new technologies in general but my heart goes to virtualization for which I grew a real interest and is in a way the foundation of every growing IT technologies nowadays. Containers, clouds, SDS, SDN, you name it, 95% chances that there is a hypervisor somewhere in the background. When time permits I run nested labs to test new features and products for potential implementation in my professional environment or simply with no real purpose apart from sharing it here.

As a day job I work as an IT consultant based in the south of France with a strong focus on infrastructure and virtualization.
I work as a freelancer with various clients on various projects where I can add value and learn something in the process.

Feel free to hit me up if you need consulting services and I'll be happy to chat.
