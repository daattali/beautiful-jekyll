Hello! My name is Edward Huh. 
Since 2020, I have been working at the [Policy Lab](https://thepolicylab.brown.edu/) as a [Data Scientist](https://thepolicylab.brown.edu/team/edward-huh/) in Providence, Rhode Island.

## Some of my interests that I am currently actively pursuing: 
* **Understanding theoretical foundations of Causal Inference:** Actively following the [Online Causal Inference Seminar](https://sites.google.com/view/ocis/home). I also have the privilege of working with amazing academics like [Jake Bowers](http://www.jakebowers.org/) and [Joe Hogan](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/jhogansc)
* **How historic socioeconomic disparities are aggravated during COVID-19:** As part of my job, I have been tracking differences in foot-traffic in among neighborhoods in Rhode Island [blog post forthcoming], and analyzing resident turnout to COVID-testing sites by demographic characteristics. Please contact me if you come across interesting metrics regarding such disparities!
* **Exploring African and Caribbean history:** As questions of race have surfaced in 2020, I realized how much of a euro and asia-centric my knowledge of world history is.
