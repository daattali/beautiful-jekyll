**Hello,**

My name is Hugo Alves and I am a Software Developer from Lisbon.

I've been professionally developing software since 2013. I work mainly with Java backend applications, all using Spring Boot with the traditional Servlet Stack. In the last couple of years I've been working exclusively with a microservices architecture.

If you want to contact me you can [email me](mailto:hugo.ma.alves@gmail.com) or find me in [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugo-alves/).

## My Projects

Apart from my day job I like to keep some side project to learn new stuff. Whenever I start to learn a new thing I like to put it in practice, it is so much easier to learn when we can see something happening.

#### [This site](#)

In this site I will try to document all my experiences with technology. Since programming to network stuff.
I will post tutorials about Spring, Linux, networking and some projects with Raspberry Pi. Some of the posts could be in Portuguese, sorry about that :).

Oh, and I also created this blog because I wanted to check out Jekyll and Github pages.

#### [Coisas de Miúdos](https://www.coisasdemiudos.pt)

The objective was to provide a platform where the Portuguese parents can buy and sell kids related stuff. For example the parents can sell the old toys that they don't need anymore, or the can buy a second hand stroller.

The stack for this project is Python+Django. The app is running in a docker container.


#### [Passar no Código](https://www.passarnocodigo.com/)

Really old stuff, sorry :(. This was my first experience with angular 1. Basically it is a site where the users can practice for their driving license exam.

  The frontend is using angular and the backend PHP with Yii framework.
