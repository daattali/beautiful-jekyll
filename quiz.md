title: Quizzes in the MDS

---

### Overview
MDS courses will have up to 2 quizzes throughout each course, typically one during a lab in the middle of the course and another after the course ends during the free days between modules. The quizzes for a course will appear on the [MDS calendar](https://ubc-mds.github.io/calendar/) (ideally before the course starts) so that students are aware of the timing. We anticipate most quizzes being 30 minutes long.

### Purpose
The purpose of quizzes are to be a "sanity check" that students are keeping up with the essential material. While labs may go more in-depth into a topic, the quizzes cover essential material that we expect students to have mastered and to retain. 

### Difficulty
In light of the purpose above, quizzes are intended to be less difficult than the labs. They are not meant to trick you nor to contain unexpected material. In short, if you did the labs without an unreasonable amount of collaboration with your classmates, you should succeed on the quizzes.

### Format
Quizzes will be in the same format as the labs (electronic, accessible via GitHub and submitted via GitHub) but will be supervised by MDS instructional staff. Quizzes will be graded using the same rubrics as labs. Quiz questions may be reworked versions of lab questions or similar material.

### Grades
The standard grading breakdown for MDS courses is as follows:

| Component | Weight |
| ------|----------|
| Quizzes | 50% | 
| Labs | 45% |
| Peer Review | 5% | 

However, this may vary from course to course.
