## story
- first sales hire under the ceo and cofounder (good friend) in sept 2013
- went to market and run the full sales process (sourcing, closing and managing) any and all deals (spray and pray-- didn't know where the money was coming from)
- managed first class of sales folks and helped operationalize our current model based on predictive revenue from sfdc (leadgen, closer, farmer)
- as the top performer, the company needed me to focus on closing
- made a bunch of money selling bigger deals (medieval times, equinox, walmart)
- company wasn't ready for it and had to take on more of a farming role and i'm a salesman at the end of the day
- left around september, took break, had a lot of fun, and now i'm excited to get back at it

After really analyzing my interests and skills over the past few months, I've come to the conclusion that the best next step for my career is to move into SalesOps.

I would love to connect with you sooner to get your insights on the SalesOps function in general and possibly identify opportunities around the city. I know I could learn so much from you, and I would really value your advice and knowledge here.
