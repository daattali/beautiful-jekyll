These instructions will walk you through how to install the required Data Science software stack for the UBC Master of Data Science program. Before starting with the installation instructions, ensure that your laptop meets our program requirements. **Students' whose laptops do not meet the requirements specified above will not be able to receive technical assistance from the MDS team in troubleshooting installation issues.**

## Laptop requirements

 - Runs one of the following operating systems: Ubuntu 20.04, macOS Big Sur (version 11.4.x or 11.5.x), Windows 10 Professional, Enterprise or Education (version 2004, 20H2, or 21H1).
    - **Windows 10 Home is not sufficient** as not all the software required for the program can be installed on that OS. [Click here to download Windows 10 Education for free from UBC.](https://it.ubc.ca/software-downloads)
