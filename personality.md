### Personality type 

![Advocate](/assets/img/personalities.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

The legal personality of Lawyer is very rare, representing less than one percent of the population, but this leaves its mark on the world. They have an ininasense of idealism and morality, but what sets it apart from the idealistic personality is their determination and firmness 

> "Lawyers are not idle dreamers, but people capable of taking concrete steps to accomplish their goals and make a positive and lasting impact. Lawyers tend to see how their goal helps others in life, but while people with this type of personality can be found engaging in rescue efforts and doing charity work, their true passion is to get to the heart of the matter so that people don't need to be rescued in any way."

My personality type is **“Advocate”** (no, I didn’t make that up and you can [test yourself here](https://www.16personalities.com/).


### Help Me and I'll Help You 

Lawyers really share a very unique combination of traits: although with a soft voice, they have very strong opinions and will tirelessly fight for an idea and in which they believe. People with this type of personality are decisive and with strong personality, but rarely use this energy for personal gain. 

Lawyers will act with creativity, imagination, conviction and sensitivity not to create advantage, but to create a balance. Egalitarianism and karma are very attractive ideas for lawyers, and they tend to believe that nothing would help the world as much as using love and compassion to soften the hearts of tyrants. 

> "Every man must decide whether to walk in the light of creative altruism or in the darkness of destructive selfishness." 
> MARTIN LUTHER KING

Lawyers find it easy to make connections with others, and have a talent for using warm and sensitive language, speaking in human terms, rather than pure logic and fact. It makes sense for your friends and colleagues to think of them as relatively social personalities, but it's good that everyone remembers that lawyers need time for themselves to be able to decompress and recharge, and not to be too alarmed when they suddenly retire. Lawyers take great care of others' feelings, and they expect the favor to be returned – sometimes that means giving them the space they need for a few days.

### Live to Fight Another Day 

But it's actually more important for lawyers to remember to take care of themselves. The passion of their convictions is perfectly capable of taking them beyond their breaking point and if their zeal is not under control, they may feel exhausted, unhealthy and stressed. This becomes especially evident when it faces conflict and criticism – their sensitivity forces them to do everything they can to escape these seemingly personal attacks, but when circumstances are inevitable, they can fight in a highly irrational and useless way. 

For lawyers, the world is a place full of iniquity – but it doesn't have to be. No other personality type is more suitable for creating a movement to correct a mistake, no matter how big or small. Lawyers just need to remember that while they are busy taking care of the world, they also need to take care of themselves.
