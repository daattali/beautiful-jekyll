We work on the advancement of software development, which is the integration of code and data analysis techniques to reduce software cost and improve software reliability and security. In general, we are interested in how software can be developed, maintained, tested in a better way through an analysis of developer habits and practices, 
and open-source software artifacts.</p>

<p align="justify">
 We perform empirical studies to understand developer's practices how they develop software, resolve issues during development, and follow the best practices. We work on their working pattern to automate software tools that help developers improve productivity. We are excited to work on various aspects of Software Engineering with the aim of high-quality software development and maintenance.</p>

<p align="justify">
Our work has been published in top/major conferences and journals in the areas of software engineering (ICSE, ICSME, APSEC, ENASE, SANER ).
