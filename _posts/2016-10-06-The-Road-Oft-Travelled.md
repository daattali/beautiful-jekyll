The Road oft travelled, yes, the one I’m on

I look around, puzzled, what’s going on?

These ones around, murky, in puddles of sin

Writhing and rolling, loud, in endless din


And then one said, straight, a held-up chin

“Think not, mister, hurry, join in, we are kin!”

I concede, accepting, my eyes again on

The Road oft travelled, yes yes, the one I’m on.
