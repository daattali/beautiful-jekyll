Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) are a powerful way of providing programmer productivity and performance when developing HPC codes. The enriched information enables effective exploitation of supercomputers, which is especially important as we reach exascale due to the high degrees of parallelism and complex heterogeneous architectures. DSLs, however, are often developed in isolation, sharing little underlying infrastructure, which can mean they are somewhat immature, suffering from bugs, a potential lack of maintenance and lack of third party tooling. 

In this BoF we will focus on how we, as a community, can consolidate our efforts and look to develop a common DSL ecosystem. Such an activity could be game-changing in providing application developers with mature, feature rich, abstract programming environments enabling effective exploitation of future HPC machines. However, the devil is in the detail and there are many challenges that must be solved to develop and provide such a solution. These include requirements driven by the application developers, the perspectives of the DSL designers and what support they need, and to the compilation stack and which are the most appropriate technologies. 

It is the intention of this BoF to provide an interactive session where we as the community can meet to discuss these aspects, highlight existing activities already underway that could compliment efforts here, and take the first step in developing a common unified ecosystem for DSL development
