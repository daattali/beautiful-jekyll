I have been at the Department of Veterans Affairs working on [Vets.gov](https://www.vets.gov) and other project for the last 684 days.  I feel very lucky to have been a part of the Digital Service at the VA (DSVA) and all the amazing work we have accomplished in the last almost 2 years. I am moving to the headquarters team of the [United States Digital Service (USDS)](https://usds.gov) on Monday (3/19/18).   I will continue to use my engineering skills to assist the US government solve technology problems, but I will also be working with the amazing talent and human resources HQ staff and working with the [Procumenati, the amazing procuement team within the USDS](https://medium.com/the-u-s-digital-service/meet-the-procuremenati-usds-acquisition-experts-1e99346822b5) to provide support from an engineering perspective.

I can say without a shadow of a doubt that I have had an impact on the lives of veterans over the last 2 years being a member of the DSVA, and I look forward to impact more aspects of the American public by moving to the USDS HQ team.  I also look forward to spending time on helping more and more folks make their way to the USDS and also become part of this amazing organization, if you would like chat please reach out I am [@RobbieTheGeek](https://about.me/robbiethegeek) everywhere online. And specifically if you are attending [DrupalCon NA](https://events.drupal.org/nashville2018) this year please reach out I will be there discussing open source / procurement within government agencies.
