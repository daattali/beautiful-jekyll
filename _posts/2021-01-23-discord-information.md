Welcome to FurSquared\! As you may know, this year FurSquared has decided to be held virtually instead of in person due to safety concerns over COVID-19. While we wish we could all be together again in one place, that’s not going to stop us from putting on the best convention experience\! All of the fun and action you expect from us can all be found on our state of the art, one of a kind, bee’s knees Discord server\!

Everything from Main Events to Dealers Den can be found in our easy to navigate server\! From the moment you log on, you’ll be in the center of all the exciting panels, showcases and experiences you’ve come to know and love. With plenty of spaces dedicated to your specific needs and wants, there’s something here for everyone. Our Main Events channel will play host to the very best programming, along with Secondary Programing\!&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Zoo is the place to talk, mingle and hang out with your fellow attendees, and if you got that artistic feeling, we have three art breakout rooms for you to enjoy. Looking to take home something or purchase some wonderful art? Our Dealers Den and Artist Alley channels are filled to the brim with the best vendors and artists, so there’s always something new to see and experience every day of the convention.&nbsp;

If Gaming is more of your cup of tea, you’ll find dedicated servers that will play host to a wide array of tabletop and video games the entire weekend. Plus, with dedicated servers for JackBox, Among Us and others, you’ll never find a lack of spaces to play and enjoy yourself.&nbsp;

Looking to make the convention a little more special? Just like at our in person events, you can register for Sponsor level membership. Along with the usual gratitude and thanks, you’ll receive one of a kind convention swag delivered right to your home, and that’s not all\! Sponsors will also be treated to your very own Role and sponsor Channel, the 13th Floor\! This dedicated space to meet and mingle with your fellow Sponsors is our special thanks to you for going above and beyond supporting the convention.&nbsp;

No matter what you choose, we look forward to seeing all of you at FurSquared. Our attentive staff will be on hand to answer any and all concerns or questions you may have over the weekend. Your enjoyment and safety are our top priority\!&nbsp;

We hope to see YOU at Fur Squared\!&nbsp;
