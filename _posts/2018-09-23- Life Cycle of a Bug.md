Bug Life Cycle is also known as Defect Life Cycle. It is a journey of Bug (Software Bug)) that goes on at different stages in his life. Suppose the software is driven by a testing process and relies on testing tools. This cycle varies from organization to organization and from project to project.

Let's Learn about the different stages of a bug's life cycle:

# New:

A test engineer at a software testing company discovered an error and posted it with a "new" status. This error is still awaiting study/approval. The fate of a new error may be the same between assign, drop, and deferred.

# Assigned:

Once the bug is posted by the test engineer, the test team leader approves the bug and assigns the bug to the development team. There are two possible scenarios, the first being that the error can be attributed directly to the developer, who is responsible for the effectiveness of the error. Second, it can also be assigned to the developer, and once it is approved by the lead leadership, he or she can take the error to the developer.

# Open / Active:

It starts when a developer starts analyzing and fixing a bug.

# Test / Fix:

When a developer modifies the required code and fixes the bug by verifying the changes, it can be called "Fixed".

# Retest / Verify:

At this stage, the tester re-examines the modified code given to him by the developer to verify that the error has been resolved. Once the latest build has been set up in the test environment, it indicates to the testing team that the Devil errors are ready for testing.

# Reopen:

If the bug persists after the developer fixes the bug, the tester changes the status to "Reopen". The bug goes through the life cycle again.

# Deferred:

Delaying the bug means that the bug is expected to be fixed in the next release. There are a number of reasons why bugs change this situation. These include bug priorities, lack of time to release, or impact on bug software.

# Dropped / Rejected:

If the developer thinks that the bug is not logical or correct, then the developer rejects the bug. Then the condition of the bug becomes "Rejected".

# Duplicate:

If a bug is posted twice or two bugs refer to the same concept, the status of the most recent bug will be "Duplicate".

# Closed:

Once the bug is fixed it is checked by the tester. If the tester thinks that the bug is no longer in the software, the tester "closes" the status of the bug. This means the bug has been fixed, tested, and approved.

# Not a bug / Enhancement:

If the functionality of the application does not change, it is given as "Not a bug / Enhancement". For example: if a customer wants to change the color of some text which is not a bug, just a slight change in the design of the application.
