On May 15th of 2015 I moved here to Alexandria, VA but my connection to the technology communities here in the DC Metro area started before I even moved here.  Once I knew I was moving to this area, I started looking around at the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) community, which I learned pretty quickly was two sister communities actually [NOVA Node](http://www.meetup.com/Nova-Node/) and [NodeDC](http://www.meetup.com/node-dc/).  Before moving from New York I was mentoring and helping to organize the [NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/) events, and wanted to make sure that I could continue that upon arrival here.  I did a bit of online sluethery and tracked down who was the owner of the [Washington DC](https://github.com/nodeschool/washingtondc) NodeSchool repository, and it turned out to be [Josh Finnie](https://twitter.com/joshfinnie).  Started following Josh on Twitter, and communicated through a few different channels, including a [pull request](https://github.com/nodeschool/washingtondc/issues/3#issue-58115513) to add a [Gitter.IM](https://gitter.im/) channel on February 18, 2015.

The first technology meetup I attended after moving here was on Monday May 18, 2015 a [NodeDC event](http://www.meetup.com/node-dc/events/221880003/) where when I arrived I met a few more of the organizers including [Juan Caicedo](https://twitter.com/_juancaicedo) and [Daniel Paz-Soldan](https://twitter.com/danpazsoldan).  Within the first 15 minutes of arriving it came up that I just moved to the area from New York, and Juan asked if I was the guy that has been talking to Josh about running NodeSchool's. Less then a month after moving here on June 13, 2015 I was leading a NodeSchool at a [Node Unconference](http://www.meetup.com/Nova-Node/events/222312195/) and since then I have co-hosted and co-organized 8 [NodeSchoolDC](http://nodeschool.io/washingtondc/) events.


This is just the beginning of my DC Tech story... I will post the next part later this week...
