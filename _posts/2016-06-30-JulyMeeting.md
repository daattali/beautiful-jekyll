### **Managing Office 365 with PowerShell**

Office 365 is an exciting and ever-growing suite of cloud applications that empowers organizations to communicate and collaborate. 
Any IT pro that is tasked with managing Office 365 needs to know how to leverage PowerShell to access advanced settings and automate repetitive tasks.
