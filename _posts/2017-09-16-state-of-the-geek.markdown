Welcome back, not sure if I am writing that to you or to me.  As always happens to my blogs I am gung ho and revved up when I start it and then it becomes a sad forgotten wasteland.  I'm going to try to rectify that and break this tread, so here we go...

First let's talk about my work life, I'm still a member of the [United States Digital Service (USDS)](https://www.usds.gov/), I have been working at the Department of Veterans Affairs for over 1.5 years with no plans to leave at the moment.  As a member of the Digital Service at the VA (DSVA) I have been working on the [Vets.gov](https://vets.gov), and I am super proud of the work we have completed so far, and the features that we have launched for veterans.  A few highlights from the last year and a half:

- [President Obama speaking at the Disabled Veterans of America about Vets.gov and my team](https://youtu.be/pA9XWXQ6vMQ?t=20m40s)
- [A Wired article about the USDS that had photos and descriptions of my team](https://www.wired.com/2016/07/inside-the-obama-tech-surge-as-it-hacks-the-pentagon-and-va/#---0-154.l2pgu8418)
- [Was a part of shooting the promotional video talking about the USDS](https://youtu.be/aGe5rEDv3g8)
- [Getting to shake the hand of President Obama](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10100765909613139&l=9a0425d7bd)
- There are so many other memories, and events that I am so happy to have been able to be apart of these all happen to be public...

In that same time period I have experienced lots of change and experiences in my personal life.  I am now living in a luxury building on the border between North Old Town / Potomac Yard and Del Ray in Alexandria.  The picture above was taken from terrace in my new place this week. I post pics a lot on social media because I can't believe this is my view, and I am moved to share with everyone.  It is a new experience living in an apartment building, with lots of amenities, and I am happily taking advantage of the pool and the gym to name a few.  Over this last summer I was lucky enough to go on an Alaskan cruise, and get to visit [Denali National Park](https://www.nps.gov/dena/index.htm).  That was a trip of a lifetime, I got to hike in Denali ride bikes in a ghost city and take my first canoe and raft experiences.  I am so grateful for the experiences I had during this trip and memories I will have for the rest of my life.  There is always change, and life goes on, but I feel really lucky.  Thanks to all the people that have been a part of my life and continue to shape it, I truly feel blessed and try hard not to be cognizant of how amazing my life, family and friends are.  I took the picture below while at a scenic view and the view was supposed to be off to the right, but I looked left and was gifted this picture.

I have also been speaking more, and this upcoming week will be giving [a talk on Imposter Syndrome](https://www.meetup.com/TechTalkDC/events/241796431) for [Tech Talk DC](https://www.meetup.com/TechTalkDC/), this is the third time I am giving this specific talk, and I look forward to the experience.  I hope that this talk and the ensuing conversation is has a positive impact on folks that are suffering from feeling less than in their technical prowess and abilities.  Look forward to [speaking later this month at about networking and helping to support and mentor attendees](https://www.meetup.com/ACM-DC/events/242933357) at [ACM Washington DC](https://www.meetup.com/ACM-DC/).  I think next month I will be speaking on a panel about community and government agencies impact on the culture here in Washington DC for a newly forming talk series, a joint collaboration between [Spoke](https://spoke.co/) and [New York Code & Design Academy DC](https://nycda.com/washington-dc).
