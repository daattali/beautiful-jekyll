So now that you've gone through, you've elicited your requirements, you've analyzed your requirements
and you specified your requirements. The last and final stat is to get the official approval. And really there's three main steps to gaining approval: 1. Business Team Approval: Who gave the requirement 2. Technical Team Approval: Who will develop the system 3. Project Sponsor / Committee Approval: Who is writing the cheque.

# Gaining Business Approval

You've gone through and defined, redefined and redefined again and making sure that number one the requirements are accurate and meet their needs. And number two, there aren't any missing or on unsolicited requirements that need to be documented through. So this is a very important first step is to gaining the business approval and on the what, the requirements and how you will be able to move forward on this to meet their business objective and meet their need.

Business Approval: Schedule
• Schedule multiple review sessions
• Separate business units
• Never exceed four hours per session
• Involve Subject Matter Experts (SME)
• Keep it relevant to the audience
• Create meeting agenda

Business Approval: Conduct 1. Explain the purpose of the meeting and the agenda 2. Review project and objective 3. Go over each requirement 4. Address questions and concerns immediately 5. Change and update requirements 6. Table all new requirements unless deemed critical

\*If critical requirements are determined, reschedule the approval meeting

# Technical Approval

So you gained the business approval and now you're working through to gain the technical approval. You want to make sure that your architects and your developers all agree with the requirements that agree that they're all feasible from a technical timeline and budget standpoint. So this is going to be very similar to the business approval.

Technical Approval: Schedule
• Session 1 - Schedule initial high level review
• Session 2 - Schedule in-depth follow up review
• Include technical Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)
• Include Technical Lead / Architect
• Create agendas for both meetings

Technical Approval: Conduct (Session 1) 1. Explain the purpose of the meeting and the agenda 2. Review project and objective 3. Touch on each section of requirements 4. Identify any major technical concerns 5. Answer questions

Technical Approval: Conduct (Session 2) 1. Explain the purpose of the meeting and the agenda 2. Review project and objective 3. Go through each requirement to validate technical feasibility 4. Identify any troublesome requirements 5. Verify enough detail for design phase 6. Make or Buy decision:
a. Make - Create high level design architecture
b. Buy – Determine options (Competitive Comparison Matrix) 7. Update project estimated cost

# Sponsor/ Committee Approval

So now you've gained the business approval and you've gained a technical understanding of the architecture and design that would be used to accomplish this particular project. And now it's all about going and getting the sponsor or the committee's approval, basically the approval of the person that actually wrote the check to make this project happen.

Sponsor Approval: Schedule
• Create presentation to talk high level about project
○ Update project schedule, cost, and risks
○ Summarize the business requirements
○ Define recommended solution
○ Anticipated transition to the solution (training, policies, job aids, etc.)
○ Majority of the presentation should be visuals and charts
• Schedule approval meeting with sponsor / committee
• Invite business and technical project leads
• Create meeting agenda
Sponsor Approval: Conduct 1. Explain the purpose of the meeting and the agenda 2. Review project and objective (sell it) 3. Give your presentation (stay at a high level) 4. Address questions and concerns immediately 5. Gain official sign-off on the project
