title:  "Teams should own problems, not solutions"
---


In an ever-evolving product development environment, it's crucial to foster an atmosphere where creativity, innovation, and collaboration thrive. In my experience, successful teams are those that focus on owning problems, not solutions. This might seem like an unconventional approach, but understanding its nuances can lead to unprecedented breakthroughs in product development.

## The Drawback of Owning Solutions
As engineers we are predisposed to think in terms of solutions. This 'solution-oriented' mindset might seem like an advantage. After all, isn't finding solutions the ultimate goal of any team? Not necessarily. Here's the hitch: by owning a solution, teams inadvertently lock themselves into a specific path, possibly ignoring better, more efficient options that might emerge in the development process.

Let's illustrate this with a common scenario. A team decides they will solve a certain problem with a specific tool, say Kafka, or a particular framework. This decision is made early in the project's lifecycle, based on initial understanding and assumptions. The team, now, is wedded to this solution. The risk? Their commitment to this predetermined solution may blind them to potential issues or better alternatives that arise later. In Data Infrastructure, we face a similar problem. Our current answer to the problem of workflow orchestration is Airflow. Any workflow orchestration improvement we think of is always thought of in terms of "how can we solve this problem in Airflow?". Airflow is a solution, the problem is reliable, autonomous and scalable workflow orchestration platform which other teams can leverage.

Owning a solution can also lead to a myopic vision, hindering creative thinking. It discourages teams from exploring other avenues and confines them within a rigid structure. In a dynamic field like product development, this rigidity can be detrimental to innovation and progress.

## The Power of Problem Ownership
Owning problems, on the other hand, offers a more fluid, adaptive approach. It pushes teams to understand the core issue deeply and enables them to adapt as they gain more insights. The focus shifts from 'how to implement a solution' to 'how to solve a problem most effectively.' It's not about using a particular tool or technology; it's about finding the best possible way to address a problem.

When teams own problems, they foster an environment of continuous learning and adaptation. They become open to pivoting their approach, embracing change when it benefits the product. They begin to see every challenge as an opportunity to learn and grow, rather than an obstacle to be overcome with a predetermined solution.

Moreover, problem ownership promotes cross-functional collaboration. Since the objective is to solve the problem, every team member's perspective becomes valuable. This inclusive approach encourages knowledge sharing and leads to more comprehensive, well-rounded solutions.

## Implementing Problem Ownership
How can teams transition from owning solutions to owning problems? Here are a few strategies:

1. Shift the Mindset: Encourage a culture that values problem-solving over solution implementation. Cultivate curiosity and open-mindedness within the team. This shift in mindset is the first step toward embracing problem ownership.

2. Encourage Deep Understanding: Invest time in understanding the problem at its root. Use techniques like the '5 Whys' or 'Fishbone diagrams' to dig deeper into issues. This understanding will form the foundation for finding the most effective solutions.

3. Foster Collaboration: Promote a collaborative environment where each team member's perspective is valued. Use techniques like brainstorming sessions or design thinking workshops to encourage sharing of ideas and solutions.

4. Embrace Adaptability: Stay open to change and ready to pivot your strategy when necessary. Adaptability is a key strength of teams that own problems.

5. Celebrate Learning: Rather than just celebrating solution implementation, celebrate learning and problem-solving. This will reinforce the culture of problem ownership.


Owning problems rather than solutions promotes flexibility, innovation, and collaboration within teams. In a rapidly changing product development environment, this approach can be the difference between creating good products and creating exceptional ones. As you move forward, remember - it's not about being right from the start, but about learning and adapting along the way to make the right decisions for your product.
