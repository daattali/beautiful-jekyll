You can write regular [markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) here and Jekyll will automatically convert it to a nice webpage.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.

Here's a useless table:
 
| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |

| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |
 

How about a yummy crepe?

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
x <- 5 + 10
print(x)
~~~

And here is some code with syntax highlighting

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```
