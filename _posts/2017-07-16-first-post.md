This is the example post from the Jekyll theme ["jekyll-beautiful"](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/) by [Dean Attali](http://deanattali.com/). I have tried various Jekyll themes before and I think this one is working so far for me. I was able to clone the [repo](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll#readme) for the theme and serve it on my local environment. Hopefully, in the next few days I will be able to replace the default minima theme I'm using on my website. It can get really boring.
