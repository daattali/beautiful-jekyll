Today 50 people showed up with only a day's notice to Senator John
Cornyn’s Central Texas office to tell him why the ACA is important
to their lives and how devastating its repeal could be. The meeting was
two hours long with groups of 12 to 25 people at a time.

The staffer we spoke to was cordial and accommodating, our stories were
personal and our concerns firmly stated. He assured us they would be
passed along to the senator.

Today our voices were heard because someone is literally paid to listen to
them. We acted as a group of concerned citizens and let our representative
know how we felt. There is no better salve for your political anxiety
than organized action. And you know what? We’ll be back!

Hopefully next time you can join us.

Thank you to everyone who participated!
