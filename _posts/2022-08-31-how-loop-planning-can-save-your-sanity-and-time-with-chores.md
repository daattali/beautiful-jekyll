Have you felt stressed out by trying to keep up with all things in your home? There are so many things to do, no matter what size your home or family is, so [loop planning](https://pambarnhill.com/loop-scheduling/#:\~:text=Loop%20scheduling%20doesn't%20assign,the%20list%20and%20start%20there.) is one strategy that can help you keep track of it all in a way that can be very low stress, too. Today on the blog, I'm sharing with you **how to make chores simple with loop planning**.

## So what's loop planning?

**A loop plan is essentially a list of things or tasks that you loop through, with no regard to time.** When you get to the end, you start back at the beginning again. You pause, stop and start as you please. That way you never feel behind or ahead, you know? Read on to see what loop planning looks like in real life. I was totally confused when I first [read about it](https://readaloudrevival.com/looping-task-management-for-recovering/), so examples are a must to learn about it!

### Why loop planning?

Loop planning is a fantastic strategy to use with home planning if you want to be consistent, but also don’t want to burn out. There are endless uses for loop planning with managing your home. I originally heard about [loop planning](https://pambarnhill.com/loop-scheduling/#:\~:text=Loop%20scheduling%20doesn't%20assign,the%20list%20and%20start%20there.) in the homeschooling world. My personal favourite is using a loop planning strategy for those "extra chores". I share about my loop chore routine [in my Instagram stories](www.instagram.com/simplehomemom) often. You can grab my free chore routine printables below as well and try them out for yourself!

#### Ways to use loop planning

1. **Loop plan your extra chores** outside of daily chores.
2. **Loop plan your homeschooling subjects** that don't need to be done daily.
3. **Loop plan your work time tasks.** I often do this when I have a few projects on the go! I set a timer and work through one at a time or a bit of each some days.
4. **Loop plan your meals, such as by using a list of 30 meals.** You start at the beginning and loop back around again when you get to the end.

#### LOOP PLANNING EXAMPLES: CHORES

_Here is one example of a loop plan that is focused on cleaning zones:_

![An example of loop planning.](/uploads/20200406_111435_0000.png "How Loop Planning Can Save Your Sanity and Time with Chores SHM")

**HOW I ORGANIZE MY CHORE LOOP PLAN FOR THOSE EXTRA CHORES:**

* I have a list of areas that I want to work on.
* I created a master task list to refer to whenever I'm in each area (such as laundry room - wipe windows, vacuum behind washer and so on).
* Currently I go through the loop on Monday-Thursday.
* I decide what I want to do when I'm working on an area and then move on when I'm done (whenever that happens to be). I worked on the master bedroom windows and decluttering a couple things this week in my closet! Sometimes I'm just focusing on cleaning or just decluttering. I decide what to do each day in my loop chore area. Right now I'm doing it all because the house really needs it all (organizing, maintenance decluttering, cleaning).

### Other loop planning ideas for chores

You can also do loop chores by ACTIVITY such as with: mopping, vacuuming, dusting or with cleaning toilets, cleaning the tub, cleaning the windows, mopping the floor (repeat). The options are completely endless with loop planning, but I love using my area method because it's easy to keep track of and I can prioritize what needs to be done each time. I can go through quickly or slowly depending on what mood or season of life I'm in. You can see how I do things by downloading my free chore routine checklists below.

**_I promise you that loop planning becomes easier with practice too!_**
