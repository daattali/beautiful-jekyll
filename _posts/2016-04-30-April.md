### We had a great turnout and engaged audience for our April meeting. Below is a quick recap and links to resources from our meeting.
-   Our very own Matt McNabb (@mcnabbmh) has been deemed a [2016 PowerShell Hero](http://powershell.org/wp/2016/04/03/announcing-our-2016-powershell-heroes/) by PowerShell.org.
-   We have our own channel in the [PowerShell Slack Team](https://powershell.slack.com). It is by invite only, [Email Us](mailto:cincypsug@outlook.com) if you need an invite.
-   PowerShell.org is part of the DevOps collective, to learn more about them visit <https://devopscollective.org>
-   The DevOps Collective has a ["GetGoing" IT Ops Education Program and Scholarship](http://www.powershell.org/wp/?p=37989). If you know of someone that is interested, the Deadline ends soon!
-   Check out the [PowerShell.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfeA8kIs7Coc1Jn5hC4e_XgbFUaS5jY2i) to watch most of the sessions from the PowerShell Summit 

### PowerShell DSC is maturing and you should start experimenting with it, if you have not already done so.  Here are some resources to help get you started - 
-   [Getting Started with PowerShell Desired State Configuration](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiHgoSf4rbMAhXLQyYKHRb9BuMQFggdMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmva.microsoft.com%2Fen-US%2Ftraining-courses%2Fgetting-started-with-powershell-desired-state-configuration-dsc--8672&usg=AFQjCNHGrzThqBYg3TqHTlKeYb1TF4Fi7g&sig2=jcJ-VP0FdwqH1PQP9FTM6w)

### Testing and Documentation is important and should become part of your daily workflow:
-   Testing and documenting helps improve code quality, quality enables fast delivery speed
-   Test and write help as your code and make changes, it makes the task less daunting by integrating it into your workflow
-   Test Driven Development (TDD) and Help Driven Development (HDD) help you to plan before you even write a single line of code.
-   Remember your help is your contract with your user, even if the user is you in 6 months or a year.
-   PSScriptAnalyser is available in the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSScriptAnalyzer/1.5.0) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer)

### Pester is a testing framework for PowerShell, if you don't know it, learn it, it will become an essential tool in your PowerShell Toolkit. https://github.com/pester/Pester
-   [Pester testing framework for PowerShell](https://www.simple-talk.com/sysadmin/powershell/practical-powershell-unit-testing-getting-started/)
-   [Getting Started with Pester](http://www.powershellmagazine.com/2014/03/12/get-started-with-pester-powershell-unit-testing-framework/)
-   [Pester in Action](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOcTmsj9WHDo2_FfKePLaq_mJTcnW_fEJ)
-   [Boe Prox Talks PowerShell and Pester – OPSUG](https://learn-powershell.net/2015/11/16/resources-available-from-my-talk-on-powershell-and-pester/)

### The main part of our talk was around Steven Murawski and Michael Greene's Release Pipeline Model. 
-   [The Release Pipeline Model](http://aka.ms/thereleasepipelinemodel)
-   [PSDeploy](https://github.com/RamblingCookieMonster/PSDeploy) is another build automation tool to help you move one step closer to a Continuous Deployment model. 
-   [psake](https://github.com/psake/psake) - another viable option for automating your build pipeline.
-   [Operation Validation Framework](https://github.com/PowerShell/Operation-Validation-Framework) is a set of tools for validating the operations of a system. This allows you to execute Pester tests that you have created to validate operations of an entire system (rather than just features).
-   This is a great follow up to the release pipeline article <https://devblackops.io/building-a-simple-release-pipeline-in-powershell-using-psake-pester-and-psdeploy/>
