This project with the Netherlands Plant Eco-phenotyping Center (NPEC) focused on transforming machine learning models into production-ready solutions, deploying them in the cloud for enhanced plant science research.

**Project Duration:** April 2024 - July 2024

## 💡 Project Summary

In this project, I converted machine learning models from a previous project into production-ready solutions for the ATHENA application. ATHENA is a Python package and cloud application designed for plant science researchers at NPEC. It enables precise organ segmentation and landmark detection on high-resolution plant images, processes new data, trains models, and predicts plant organs, providing a heatmap indicating the model's confidence for each pixel.

## 👨‍💻 MLOps Integration

Key components of the MLOps integration included:
- **Code Development:** Created robust, modular code with thorough documentation, logging, and unit testing.
- **Automated Pipelines:** Established data ingestion and model training pipelines on Microsoft Azure, utilizing versioned data assets and managed environments.
- **Deployment Strategy:** Devised and executed an Azure-based deployment strategy, integrating APIs for model inference and training, and used Docker containers for environment encapsulation.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Implemented monitoring to ensure prediction accuracy and model performance, with mechanisms for timely retraining.

## 🚀 Technical Achievements

- **Cloud Integration:** Deployed models to achieve scalable and reliable machine learning solutions in the cloud.
- **FastAPI Integration:** Utilized FastAPI to develop efficient APIs for model interaction.
- **Containerization:** Employed Docker containers to maintain consistent and reproducible environments.
- **Automated Reporting:** Generated reports to monitor unit test coverage and used Sphinx for comprehensive documentation.
- **Custom CLI:** Developed a command-line interface (CLI) for managing training and inference pipelines.
