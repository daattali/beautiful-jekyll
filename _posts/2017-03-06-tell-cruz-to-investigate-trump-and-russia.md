Russian intelligence illegally interfered in the American Presidential election on behalf of the Trump campaign while Trump surrogates where meeting with Russian officials. Some of these surrogates have since lied about these contacts under oath.

**SIGN UP to ATTEND** the in-person action at senator Cruz’s office. **WRITE A LETTER** to SENATOR CRUZ asking that he **SUPPORT A FULL INVESTIGATION** into the Trump administration's ties to Russia to read aloud or deliver to his office on Tuesday at noon.

## SAMPLE LETTER
