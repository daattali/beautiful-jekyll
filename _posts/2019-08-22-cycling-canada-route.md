The trip began in Victoria B.C. where we dipped our tires into the Pacific Ocean at the Terry Fox Memorial. From there we cycled East to Halifax where we finished at Crystal Crescent Beach, dipping our tires into the Atlantic.

## Route Notes

- The Hwys In BC, Alberta, SK, and Manitoba are all excellent for the most part, they all have their own sketchy parts, but overall they are very safeHighway Advice
- The stretch across Ontario will suck, try and avoid being hit by pig trucks especially
- There is little to no shoulder, and sometimes rumble strips force you to ride on the actual highway
- Quebec is actually very rider friendly and has safe roads, stick to La Route Vert and you will be good
- The first stretch of Nova Scotia Hwy is excellent on the Trans Canada but as soon as you see the option to get on Hwy 4 take it, because the shoulder is about to disappear
- Wearing reflective vests is probably a good idea and we did it for the majority of the trip, even from an airplane we were visible
- Also we would recommend front and rear lights, even if you don’t plan on riding in the dark there was still sometimes heavy fog where lights were needed

## Highway Details

- We did not record our exact route everyday but here is a general outline of the roads we took
- From Mile 0 to the Ferry Terminal we took Hwy17
- From Tsawwassen to Abbotsford we took the Fraser Hwy
- From Abbotsford to Mission we took Hwy 11
- From Mission to Hope we took the Lougheed Hwy (Hwy 7)
- From Hope to Kamploops we took the Trans Canada (Hwy 1)
- We then remained on Hwy 1 all the way to Ontario where it turns to Hwy 17
- From Ontario border to Arnprior we remained on the 17
- This stretch has very small to no shoulders and is the worst stretch in terms of safety, unfortunately it is a huge stretch
- At Anrprior it changes to a much busier highway the 417
- From Anrprior to Nepean we stayed on 417
- From Nepean to Capital Hill we then took small side roads
- Capital Hill to Quebec Border we took Hwy 17 (Old until it turns into new)
- From Quebec border to the bridge to cross into Mtl we took Hwy 342
- We then took Hwy 20 across the water into Mtl (much safer than Hwy 40)
- From here we stuck to the North Side of the St. Lawrence River
- We found a bike route called La Route Vert all the way to Quebec City
- The route is all on roads but most have shoulders and are safe to ride
- Quebec City to Levis we took a Ferry to cross the St. Lawrence
- The bride to cross is extremely busy so we would recommend this
- From Levis to Riviere Du Loup we took Hwy 132
- From Reviere Du Loup to New Brunswick Border we took Hwy 185
- From New Brunswick Border to Grand Falls we took Hwy 144
- From Grand Falls to Hartland we took Hwy 105
- From Hartland to Woodstock we took Hwy 103
- From Woodstock to Woolastook we took Hwy 2 (Trans Canada)
- From Woolastook to Fredriction we took Hwy 102r
- Hwy 102 to Gagetown, where we then crossed the river to Hwy 105 to Grand Lake
- After Grand Lake we took Hwy 105 to Hwy 2 (Trans Canada)
- We stayed on the Trans Canada till just before Moncton
- Into Moncton we took the 106 (at Salisbury)
- Stayed on 106 till Memramcook where we got back on Hwy 2
- Stayed on Hwy 2 until Nova Scotia border where it turns into the 104
- Stayed on Hwy 104 until Wentworth Collingwood Road where we got onto the 4 (You should just get on 4 earlier to save yourself time and stress)
- Then took Hwy 4 all the way to Truro
- From Truro to Halifax we took Hwy 2
- From Halifax to Sambro (Crystal Crescent Beach) we took Hwy 349
- Then we were done
