Sometimes it's really, really hard to get that "self care" time in over here with four kids. Sometimes I am relying on a few minutes here and there. Building it into my routine. Changing it up for different seasons of life. It really takes an extraordinary amount of flexibility and creativity. What's self care for moms? According to [this blog](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/on-parenting/in-defense-of-a-parents-day-off/2017/01/23/270ffafc-d8f2-11e6-b8b2-cb5164beba6b_story.html) from Washington Post:

> **Self**-**care** is not selfish; it's one of the best things you can do for your kids. Taking a break from family can cause guilt and anxiety in **mothers** and fathers alike. ... Being on and at the ready for your children at all times can cause burnout and make things that could be everyday treasures feel like everyday chores.

Today on the blog I’m sharing three ways to be creative with squeezing in some rest/self care with a busy household.

## Headphones

Yep. I said it. 🎧 If the kids are loud, but playing nicely, I can put on some sound reducing headphones or listen to an audiobook. A more traditional tyoe of headphones or noise cancelling headphones.

## Bathroom breaks

Leave a book in there, affirmations to read over on the mirror or something that even a minute or two will help add some rest your day.

## Call a friend

I often do this with noise in the background. Even just a few minutes talking to another adult can help fill your cup just a little bit more.
