### **Year in Review**

It is hard to believe that 2016 is coming to a close! We have covered a wide variety of topics this year that we felt that we needed to review them all. So if you weren't able to attend these sessions, be sure to stop by and we will bring you up to speed. 

- January - PowerShell DSC with Mr. Ashley McGlone
- February - PowerShell 5 Classes with June Blender
- March - Managing Infrastructure with Josh Atwell
- April - PowerShell Summit Recap
- May - PowerShell: Back to Basics 
- June - Operations Management Suite and DSC with Ed Wilson "The Scripting Guy"
- July - Managing Office 365 and PowerShell with Matt McNabb
- August - PowerShell Application Deployment Toolkit (PSAppDeployToolkit)
- September - Disaster Recovery as Code
- October - PowerShell and SQL Roundup
- November - Rest APIs and PowerShell with Mike Smith

We want to hear what you have been working on, bring code to share/review with the group in 5-10 minute session. If we have time left, we will split off into groups to solve scripting puzzles/code golf based on these topics.

## Sponsor:

SAPIEN Technologies will be sponsoring the Cincinnati PowerShell User Group meeting and will be supplying the pizza!
