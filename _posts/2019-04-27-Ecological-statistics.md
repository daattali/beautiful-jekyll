Statistics in ecology can be a tricky endeavour with real data. My PhD research focuses on Bayesian Hierarchical Modelling with Ecological Data. These are the resources I have used and still do at times. To begin to understand and teach Bayesian methods I often refer to older and often more understood statistical methods.

## General ecological statistics

These are the resources I often talk about and personally use regularly. I have only added my brief notes and am no way affiliated or represent any of the resources below. I haven't meet many of these researchers and developers but hopefully one day. Most of the resources are open-source and are forked to my personal [github account](https://github.com/davan690/).

[Colby Ecology Course](https://colbyecology.github.io/): A mathematical ecology course that I have not done but I think it looks pretty kol. Let me know if anyone does it.

[STAT545](http://stat545.com/Classroom/): This is an amazing graduate course from the University of British Columbia. I will often return to this course to check code and explanations I need.

[Monash stats help page](https://monashbioinformaticsplatform.github.io/r-more/topics/tidyverse.htmlMonash/): This is a simple html page similar to this with information for Monash bio-informatics platform.

[Cheat-sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/): These are really important and RStudio do many good ones. There are many other variations out there though.

[The Statistics Network](https://davan690.github.com/usefulr/): My personal list of resources but in particular look at the `usefulr` repository. I am updating this as and when I find new resources. Mostly, this list is to support my own development and to remind myself how to do many of these R and Markdown tricks and tips I find on the web.

### Bio-informatics

I often work with colleagues in genetics and have done a small bit of work with [dartR]("https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dartR/"). Here is a very limited list of genetics resources for statistics. I am no way an expert with these packages or analyses but have a look here for some detailed resources and lab discussions with [Arthur Goerges](http://georges.biomatix.org/)

- [Workbook from compgenr package](https://al2na.github.io/compgenr/Genomics/)

- [Comparative Genomics workbook](https://isugenomics.github.io/bioinformatics-workbook/)

- [DartR Genomics workbook](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dartR/vignettes/IntroTutorial_dartR.pdf)

- [R population genetics workbook](https://github.com/green-striped-gecko/PopGenReport/)
