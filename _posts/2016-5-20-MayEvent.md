### **Bring a friend/co-worker and Learn PowerShell!**

Are you or a friend/co-worker wanting to get started with PowerShell and automation but aren't sure how? This is the meeting for you! 

For those of you that may already know, PowerShell is both a language and an administrative shell with which you can control and automate nearly every aspect of Windows. It accepts and executes commands immediately, and you can write scripts to manage most Windows servers like Exchange, IIS, and SharePoint. 

We will be covering the basics (command syntax, using help, teaching yourself how to discover commands, using the pipeline, using modules, etc) as well as some tips to give you a basic understanding of the language quickly. 

## Sponsor:

SAPIEN Technologies will be sponsoring the Cincinnati PowerShell User Group meeting and will be supplying the pizza!
