Not long ago, I did up a couple blogs on our [current laundry routine](https://www.eastcoastkelly.com/cleaning%20&%20tidying/2020/04/30/our-current-laundry-routine-that-has-taken-the-stress-off-of-laundry.html) and was interested to hear how others did theirs. I had a couple friends reach out to me to share theirs. Perhaps you will find them helpful as well!

From Samantha, a mom of one little boy:

> Under normal circumstances we both work full time outside of the home, and often spend every second weekend or so with our extended family on the South Shore.
>
> Laundry can be one of the most difficult tasks I find! So I created a schedule to follow:  
> Mondays-Linens and Household  
> Tuesdays-Kids Stuff  
> Wednesdays- Mommy’s stuff  
> Thursdays-Daddy’s Stuff  
> Fridays-Catch Up load. Whatever clothing needs to be washed gets thrown in the washer.  
> Every 2nd Saturday-Bed Sheets & Outdoor clothes
>
> I put a load in every morning at 5:30, and hang it to dry before we leave the house at 7:10. Often it’s ready to be folded that evening before bed!

From Christa, a mom of five:

> I make a killer natural homemade laundry soap. I run 2 washers and 2 gas dryers….4 loads every day. I use clothes line as much as possible! I fold all clothes because I am picky. I put into piles on my 14’ dining room table, then all kiddos divide and conquer the delivering to rooms and bathrooms! I take Sundays off!! I also only separate two times. One is towels and underwear washed in hot water. All other clothes get washed together!

_Your laundry routine is probably going to look different, but hopefully looking at these examples will give you a good place to start. And if your wardrobe needs a total rehaul and you have a hard time knowing where to start, you may enjoy my Simple Capsule Wardrobe Guide. Some recent feedback on it: “Ahhh Kelly! That was brilliant! I’m going to do some sorting this weekend, more purging, and most importantly writing down what I have vs what I need. Thank you!!!” If you’d like that guide, feel free to email me at_ [_simplehomemom@gmail.com_](mailto:eastcoastkellyb@gmail.com) _and I can send that off to you._
