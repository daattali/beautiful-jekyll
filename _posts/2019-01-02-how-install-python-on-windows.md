## Install python on your work Environment 

To install Python, download Python 3.6 (or higher) from  [Python Official](https://www.python.org/downloads/) .

I recommend you to download Python latest (Python 3.6.3, currently) installer for Windows. If you have a different OS, download binaries accordingly. You may choose an x86-64 installer if you have a 64-bit system. Choose an x86 installer if you have a 32-bit system. But you can also click on the download button in the page header.

It  Extremely important: when you install it, make sure to check "Add Python to PATH".

**Install Python on Windows: Advanced Options while Installing Python**
Next, it gives you a set of advanced options:
- Install for all users
- Associate files with Python (requires the py launcher)
- Create shortcuts for installed applications
- Add Python to environment variables
- Precompile standard library
- Download debugging symbols
- Download debug binaries (requires VS 2015 or later)
- You may also specify the location to install the directory at.

You have now installed Python. Now, you can find a list of programs in the Start Menu.
Once Python is installed, you can execute the program "cmd.exe ". This is a command-line interface to your computer. Here, just type the word python  and that will start the Python program.

You can use the Integrated DeveLopment Environment **(Python IDLE)**  to code in Python which will be install during the installation, no need need to install any fancy IDE. If you use the Python Shell, you can use it as an interpreter. Otherwise, you can create a new file to write a Python program. Later, you can save it and click ‘Run’ to run the program. 


At all points during the course, you can always type python name_of_file.py  and that will execute the code of a file called name_of_file.py .

To install **PyCharm** Python IDE, just download the Community Edition (which is free) from

[Download Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) .
