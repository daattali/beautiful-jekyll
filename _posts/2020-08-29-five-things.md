“Monday is the perfect day to correct last week’s mistakes.” A fresh start, right? I love to jump into a new week and forget about last week. I mean, learn from yesterday, last week, but face the day and week with a new lens, and with the learned lessons from last week. Today on the blog, I'll be sharing with you five things that people who have morning routines figured out do to have the best morning ever (to set them up for success for the day, week).

From [a blog](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennifercohen/2018/04/09/9-morning-hacks-for-your-best-day-ever/#6cb48dca6e28) I found on starting the day if you'd like to work on this kind of thing too - to start your day from a place of rest:

## Wake up early

(confession: nope. not me in this season of life, but waking up early can be good for many people). In fact, [this study](https://nypost.com/2019/06/11/waking-up-early-can-make-you-happier-and-healthier-study/#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20new%20international%20research,stressed%20under%20their%20new%20sleep) suggests that waking up early can have a major positive impact on your mental health. Also, going to bed early too. I know I feel better when I’m on a healthier going to bed, wake up routine.

## Smiling and thinking about something good

Smiling and thinking about something good about your upcoming day can set the tone for the rest of the day, week. I usually start my day with positive[ affirmations](https://www.eastcoastkelly.com/morning%20routine/2020/05/06/how-to-help-reduce-the-feeling-of-overwhelm-as-a-mom-by-using-this-one-simple-practice.html) and I find that can help set the tone for the whole day.

## Drink some water

Drink a glass of water to reverse any thrist from overnight. I don’t think I’m dehydrated in the mornings, but hey, drinking water is always a good idea, right? Especially if your morning choice of hot drink is coffee. Take a peek at [this article](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/drinking-water-in-the-morning#popular-claims) here about drinking water and some myths, benefits.

## Sitting in the quiet

Pray or sit in the quiet. The quiet is oftentimes when our brains have a chance to think things through and come up with new insights. Sitting in the quiet will help calm and focus us for the day.

## Reading

Grab a book and read a little. Even a little bit every day can add up to a lot over time. Allowing the time for learning something new or reading a book you’ve put off. This is a great time to read. And to chew through the content, think about it the rest of the day.

_Also - Last year, I finally started a morning routine for myself and it’s really helped my days out so much. I feel more peaceful throughout the rest of the day and I’m finding time for those things that matter most to me. It was after I read the book_ [_The Miracle Morning_](https://amzn.to/398G8nw) _that everything clicked for me. I was so inspired. If you’d like a quick breakdown of what the Miracle Morning is and have an overview of how to create your own, I can send you a basic overview from what I read. Feel free to email me at_ [_simplehomemom@gmail.com_](mailto:simplehomemom@gmail.com) _if you’d like that._
