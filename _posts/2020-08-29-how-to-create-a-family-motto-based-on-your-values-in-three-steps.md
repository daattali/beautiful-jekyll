When I went through the whole decluttering thing years back and started learning about [minimalism](https://amzn.to/2WdA0oD), I learned a couple of things:

1. Minimalism is not about white walls.
2. Minimalism is about removing the “noise” to find what matters most to you.

And on discovering this, I was able to much more clearly see and remove things from our lives that did not work for us. I was able to more clearly see the direction we wanted to go as a family. Our values. Our views. The things that gave life to us. Being able to clearly see this as a family will help navigate the day to day. The to do list. The priorities. The routines. Discovering and defining core values will direct your now and the future. Today on the blog I’ll be sharing with you how to create a family motto based on your values in three steps.

## Step one. Start with this simple exercise: grab a pen and paper!

Want to figure out quickly what your true values are? Take a moment and do this simple exercise: Look at what your family _does_, your actions. What things do you do on the daily? Write them down.

Such as:

* Do you get outside together?
* Play board games together?
* Watch tv together?
* Eat dinner together?
* Read together?
* Listen attentively to each other?
* Do projects together?
* Do you value being hospitable?

This list could go on and on, but take some time to think, and perhaps quickly jot down those that come to mind. This is a great place to start.

Here are some of my personal values, for reference:

* I value growth. Daily time spent growing in areas I want to grow in (i.e. spiritual, learning new things, hobbies, business development etc).
* I value close family relationships. I take time daily to check in with my people. And listen to what they are sharing with me.
* I value hard work. To give my all at what I do.
* I value taking care of myself to take care of others. Both physical, mental, and spiritual daily.

## Step two. Dive deep into your priorities as a family.

Dive in on that list and mark what is a priority right now and what you’d like to be a priority – add those things that you want to become a priority. Maybe through the above exercise, you'll also discover what you thought your family valued, but really don't based on your actions. I thought we valued getting outside....but we haven't been getting out much this year together. But that can be changed once you are aware, right? Nothing is set in stone.

## Step three. Draft together a simple motto with your family values’ list.

Last year, we came up with a homeschooling family motto based on our values too. But you can apply this to your family as well, even if you don't homeschool outside of this pandemic! Just take out the word homeschooling.

Ours says:

> In our homeschool, we strive to be flexible. Independent. Build each other up. In our homeschool, we refuse to give up or just get by.

We're using this time to work on sibling relationships. Communication. Closeness. Taking time to listen to one another. Solving problems. And we’ll be working on updating our own family values and then family motto in the near future too.
