## Introduction 1.1

Invasive species database *A database (DB) for invasive species in New Zealand (NZ)*

Creating a database of research to understand the current knowledge of observation and/or population level demographics of New Zealand invasive species.

**NOTE:** This is already part of a standard literature review and if this does not get any further than that it is a bonus.

## Introduction 1.2

Dealing with Reproducibility *Why and how to make a reproducible workflow for invasive species research in New Zealand*

This chapter creates a workflow that allows the ability to access and use the invasive species database in a reproducible way.... Etc etc

Importance of reproducibility between community groups etc

We also conduct a meta-analysis to shows that even though the time it takes to reproduce a workflow comes back THIS>...

- Citation records (Google scholar and elsivear)
- Collaborations (international vs domestic)
- Outreach (twitter/fb).

Packages used:

- Revtools
- Scholar
- Python?
