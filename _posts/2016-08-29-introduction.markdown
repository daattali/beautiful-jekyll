# What's Going on Here?

I know that for a lot of people, what goes on in the IS department is a bit of a mystery. People ask for something, and voila! It appears (at some indeterminate point in the future). What goes on in that middle part, where we're busy toiling away building stuff, is where the magic happens.

I intend to de-mystify how we build software, for a couple of reasons. First, it's important that everyone have a good understanding of what it takes to build great software. Second, the processes and ideas that we follow, in particular, are applicable to more than just the process of building software. The methodologies and approaches we use can be much more widely applied to help all of us solve problems.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. 

Another thing I want to do is give a forum to provide regular updates on what exactly we *are* working on, and how we are progressing towards those things. The processes that we use to build our software are based on transparency and communication, so I want to make sure we're spreading that transparency beyond our immediate stakeholders.

Finally, I want to have a place for some random thoughts, and to introduce everyone to the team, and just have fun.

So, welcome to our little corner of the world!
