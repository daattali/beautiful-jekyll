Michael McCaul has announced a so-called "telephone town hall" for Wednesday evening at 7:00PM. We need to take this opportunity to engage with our representative and remind him that thousands of us are dedicated to holding him accountable.

**REGISTER for representative McCaul’s TELEPHONE TOWN HALL**. Once you have registered, **WRITE a QUESTION** to ask. If you are selected to ask a question, please **preface your question by asking representative McCaul to schedule an in-person town hall.**
