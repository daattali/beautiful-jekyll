There are two marches planned for this weekend, and we're encouraging all members of Indivisible to come out to these family-friendly events!

It's *imperative* that we start Trump's term in full resistance mode, and like sister rallies across the country, these Austin marches are looking to be *very* well-attended. There's nowhere else you'd rather be on this unholiest of weekends! And don't forget to spread the word!
