I've noticed over the years as we've added on more kids that I (and they) do better with flexible rhythms to our days vs. completely structured days. This is just what works for us, at least right now. I’ve tried the schedule type idea many times, but always hit a wall of it not working and just generally stressing me out. Today on the blog I’m sharing with you how to create a daily rhythm at home (by giving you examples of our rhythm throughout the day too).

# What’s a rhythm?

According to the [Cambridge dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/rhythm): "a regular movement or pattern of movements" or "a regular pattern of change, especially one that happens in nature". So, applying that to our day - that is a regular pattern that we go about our day. Predictable. Natural. Free flowing.

## How to create a rhythm for your days

I focus on our priorities and the energy levels of the kids and myself and base it all around that.

## Examples of our daily rhythms

_Mornings_: We all naturally wake up usually around 7-7:30. I need about 30 minutes to get going for the day. We usually have breakfast around 8. The energy is lower here, so I usually take some time for quiet reading and prayer.

_Midmornings_: After breakfast, we head into school after getting ready for the day. If it’s not a school day, we’ll dive into some activity. Projects around the house, getting outside, just some kind of movement. My natural energy levels usually dip by about 11, so we aim to be done school around then to have some free play time or whatever else pops up. I usually spend some time here doing some work – usually a social media post or blog or the likes of that. We then naturally break for lunch around 12.

_Afternoons_: For years now, we’ve had quiet time in the afternoons. It used to be just nap time, but with various ages in our family, it’s now called quiet time. At 1pmish most days, I set the boys up for their quiet time. “Hey boys! It’s quiet time. Pick a tidy task to do in your room, read your book for your school reading for x amount of time, and then play quietly until Josie is asleep.” This lasts from about 1 to 2 depending on the day. It’s a nice period of time for me too to usually have some quiet. Sometimes I’ll just rest. Sometimes I’ll read or answer emails. When Josie is asleep, the boys now can have a bit of screen time until Josie is awake and while I usually work here. Some days, I do choose to rest, depending on the day. But most days, I enjoy working in the quiet. I pop on an audio training usually and go about some of the priority work tasks.

Evenings: We have supper around 5 right now and aim for getting ready for bed at 6:30 with everyone. Pyjamas on, cleaned up, in bed. I usually exercise with the baby during this time here too as I’ve found it to be the best time of day for me. I’m usually toast after that, so if I have any work left to do, I make sure it’s more lowkey, not as much thinking kinds of tasks. I’ve recently been trying to end the day with a bit of writing, reading, praying too. The best way to end the day for myself and to encourage a restful sleep too!
