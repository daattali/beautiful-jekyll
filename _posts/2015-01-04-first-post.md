Algal blooms can pose a threat to an aquatic ecosystem, the economy, and even
public health. Not all algal blooms are harmful, as an abundance of algae would
result in a large food supply for the organisms in that environment. They are
harmful, however, when they cause hypoxia or when they become toxic.

*Hypoxia* occurs when there is a depletion of oxygen in a marine environment.
This is most likely a result of *eutrophication*, which is when there is an
overabundance of nutrients present in the water, which then leads to an increased
growth of algae. This is usually caused by runoff related to agricultural
practices, as phosphorus pollution leads to an increased algae growth in waters.

Hypoxia can lead to the creation of a *dead zone*, as having little to no oxygen
would result in the death of marine life. Toxins produced by harmful algal blooms
have deeply affected the economy and health of the environment, as well as the
public. Coastal towns and cities that rely on tourism are negatively affected by
toxic algal blooms. People that live in those areas are vulnerable to illnesses
caused by the toxins that are produced, which some can even be fatal. It is also
detrimental to the environment, as these toxins also can result in the death of
marine life, and severely impact an aquatic ecosystem.
