The proposal was approved tonight and moves on to a full vote tomorrow (Tuesday).

Please call Rep. McCaul's office tomorrow morning and ask them to restore
independent ethics oversight to the House Rules package. The phone number
for the Austin office is: 512-473-2357

This is an important issue to press because the incoming administration
ran on a "drain the swamp" promise and this is the opposite.
