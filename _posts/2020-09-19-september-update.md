# Website Updates
If you're looking around, we're slowly adding to the information here, especially over at [the volunteer page](/volunteer).

# Staff applications
We haven't forgotten about y'all!  Unfortunately the pandemic has had a lot consequences, and after our meeting this Sunday we're going to be better able to onboard folks.  Expect to hear from us by the end of the month.

# What about VR Chat?
A Fur Squared VR Chat world is still in progress, but it's too early for us to talk a lot about it.  We really hope to be able to in October!

# Is panel submission still open?
Yes!  [Click here to learn more about Virtual Fur Squared Programming](/programming).

# Dealers?  Artists?
More to come!
