Welcome Again! I am going to share with you some python code for very basic level for the starter.

# Part 1- Variable declaration in Python.

```py
a="dhaka"
b="dhaka"

print(a)

a=123

print(a)
print(b)

b=456
print(b)

c='dhaka'
d=c

print(c==d)
print(d is c)
```

## Some Variable Declaration Rules:

- Reserved word (keyword) can not be a variable
- Start with letter or underscore
- Don’t start with a number
- Variable name can contain letters, number, underscore
- Don’t include special characters in variable names

# Part 2- Playing with Numbers.

```py
int_num = 10
float_num = 20.0

print(int_num)
print(float_num)

a = 10
b = 20

print("*******************")

add = a + b
print(add)

sub = b - a
print(sub)

multi = a * b
print(multi)

div_mychoice = b / a
print(div_mychoice)
```

# Part 3- Get to know python Boolean .

```py
a = True
b = False

print(a)
print(b)

print("**************************")
print(bool(0))
print(bool(1))
print(bool(2))

c = ""
print(bool(c))

c = "Some Value"
print(bool(c))
```

# Part 4- String in Python .

```py
a = "This is a simple string"
b = 'Using single quotes'

print(a)
print(b)

c = "Need to use 'quotes' inside a string"
print(c)

d = "Another way to handle \"quotes\""
print(d)

a = "This is a single\
 string"
print(a)
```

# Part 5- Sample Excercies with Code .
