This is a demo post to show you how to write blog posts with markdown.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](https://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.



## Language learning passion
I always have a passion for languages, especially for east Asian laguages.

## Never give up
I tell myself that I never give up on things I like.
