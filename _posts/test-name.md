You can write regular [markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) here and Jekyll will automatically convert it to a nice webpage.

How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](http://lafenicegelato.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/crepes-with-chocolate.jpg)

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
x <- 5 + 10
print(x)
~~~

And here is some code with syntax highlighting

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
