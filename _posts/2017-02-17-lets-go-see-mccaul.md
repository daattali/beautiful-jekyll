Despite our **_MANY_** phone calls asking for a town hall, Rep. McCaul has not scheduled any during his week in district, which starts on Monday. Furthermore, his office has flatly told us he is not willing to meet with constituents while he's in Austin. _They won't even tell us which days he'll be in town!_

## Action - Office Visit (All Week)
So we think we should pay his Austin office a visit. **EVERY DAY NEXT WEEK (February 20th - 24th, 2017)**. Doesn't have to be a big crowd, 10-20 people per day would be fantastic. Most groups will probably just be airing their concerns to staffers, but maybe one lucky group will catch McCaul there himself--who knows?

## We Need You!

We need to find 1 or 2 people who can volunteer to be on-the-ground leaders for each day (so 5-10 total).

Katie and I can help organize the whole schedule, but because of work may not be able to be there every day, so we need people who can take point. It's not a difficult job--if you've been to any office visits you probably get the gist--and we'll be available to offer as much help as you need. It will require a little front-end organizing and then probably no more than 90 minutes at his office.


If you can be an Office Visit Leader, please let us know via [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/tx10indivisible/permalink/410264039314871/) comments or email [info@tx10indivisible.us](mailto:info@tx10indivisible.us?subject=McCaul Office Visit Leader 2017-02-17). Please include what day you'd like to volunteer for.

We will be in touch with more details over the weekend!

**THANKS!**
