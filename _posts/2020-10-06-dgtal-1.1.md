This video showcases:
* a quad mesh reconstruction from a low resolution voxel set using [DigitalSurfaceRegularization](https://dgtal-team.github.io/doc-nightly/moduleRegularization.html),
* from normal vectors obtained from [Integral Invariants](https://dgtal-team.github.io/doc-nightly/moduleIntegralInvariant.html) which have been piecewise smooth regularized using the [Ambrosio-Tortorelli functional](https://dgtal-team.github.io/doc-nightly/moduleGenericAT.html),
* and visualized in [polyscope-dgtal](https://github.com/dcoeurjo/polyscope-dgtal).

Many more features to come...
