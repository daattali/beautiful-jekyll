Add another buzzword phrase to your vocabulary, "Disaster Recovery as Code".  Join us as we explore what this means and how it can be applied in the real world for disaster recovery testing and automating recovery.  
We’ll talk theory, challenges, and show some real world examples of Disaster Recovery as Code to help you on your way to treating "all the things" as code.
