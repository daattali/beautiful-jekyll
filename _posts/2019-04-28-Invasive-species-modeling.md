# Thesis

My PhD work involves modelling invasive species dynamics in NZ forests. There is more detail for my supervisors and colleagues. Please excuse all the '404' errors as I am learning and working as I go. Using version control and git means that I am able to use other coders templates and test things out before committing.

## Running title

Population dynamics of interacting invasive species in New Zealand forests. 
!<--[Here]() are some other options.-->
