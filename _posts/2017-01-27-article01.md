## Protest in Temple

Many Indivisible folks will be heading to Temple this afternoon to
join the Bell County Democrats in a protest outside the Convention
Center where Sen. Cornyn is the key speaker. There aren’t many
opportunities for action against our senators directly, so come if
you can make it! With Trump’s latest talk about walls and tariffs
getting pushback from Texas Republicans, this is a perfect time to
encourage them to defy the White House!

## Oppose Trump's cockamamie wall

**CALL TODAY** and ask Sen. Cornyn and Rep. McCaul to oppose Trump's cockamamie wall

Trump has really put Texas Republicans in a tough spot. Economists expect any tariff on Mexico to negatively impact the Texas economy. Many of them are already considering opposing him on this. This is just the kind of issue that can drive a wedge between Trump and Congressional Republicans, so we’ve got to let our reps know that we want them to defy him!

**CALL** Sen. Cornyn and Rep. McCaul and ask them to oppose any Trump plan for financing the wall that negatively impacts the Texas economy!

### Sample Script

> Hello, my name is ______ and I am a constituent of [Sen. Cornyn or Rep. McCaul]. I’m calling to ask him to OPPOSE the 20% tariff on Mexican imports and any other plan that asks Texans to unfairly bear the burden of paying for Trump’s wall. Texas officials and businesses AGREE that this plan would threaten Texas jobs, weaken the Texas economy and drive up the cost of living for Texas families. I’m counting on my representatives to put the interests of their constituents first. Thank you.
