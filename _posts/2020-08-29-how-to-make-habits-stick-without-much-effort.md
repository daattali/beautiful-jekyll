Are you fighting to make habits stick without much results? Life is full of ups and downs, but there are some simple tweaks that can be made to make habits you want to do a regular basis stick, even when they get dropped once and a while due to life. Today on the blog, I'm sharing how to make habits stick without much effort.

_Habit stacking._ Have you heard of habit stacking before?

> Habit stacking is a strategy you can use to group together small changes into a routine that you follow daily. The key to consistency is to treat a habit stack like a single action instead of a series of individual tasks. (from [developinggoodhabits.com](http://www.developinggoodhabits.com/)).

When I want to add something new into my routine or just plain want to be more consistent with something, I sometimes will lean on this idea of habit stacking. It has a higher chance of sticking if it's stacked with an already established habit. It's pretty neat how it works that way.

Here are a few examples that I've habit stacked:

- Every time I go to a bathroom, I drink a glass of water.
- When I go down for breakfast, I bring down a load of laundry and turn on a wash.
- When I get ready for the day or for bed, I listen to an audiobook.
- When my husband comes out from putting the four year old to bed, that’s my exercise time.
- After I sit down to supper, I ask my children the best thing about their day.

I try to habit stack habits that have been having a hard time sticking and also ones that I want to make priority too. My most recent one was audiobook + getting ready. I've been loving doing this so far!
