### **Introduction to Git, Github, and version control**

As IT Ops folks, version control isn't always a given.  The Powershell Team and Powershell community are rich with collaboration, so learning git and github is essential!  We will be diving into version control, specifically Git/Github, how to start, how to contribute and why it should be an essential part of your operations teams and workflows whether your just a lone admin writing "throw away" scripts, or a full on DevOps shop.  Come join us as we explore git and why its a must to have in your arsenal of tools.

## Sponsor:

SAPIEN Technologies will be sponsoring the Cincinnati PowerShell User Group meeting and will be supplying the pizza!
