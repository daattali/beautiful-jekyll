Flexibility is key in our family of four kids here and last month, we had a big awakening of something that just was not working anymore. A couple years ago, we clued into the fact that bedtime routine is much, much easier when we stagger the kids vs. try to get them ready all at the same time. It gets very loud if we do that. And likewise, dinner time was becoming a place of chaos here with siblings not getting along and meals not being eaten because of it. For a long time. Today on the blog, I'm sharing with you how to have a more peaceful dinner time even with a house of young children.

![Expectations quote.](/uploads/untitled.png "quote")  
My friend shared a version of this quote with me last month. She knows me. I was sharing with her about how my "dream" of what a "good family" does was having a beautiful dinner together every day. You know? The table set. The voices quiet. _Meaningful time together_.

## Undoing expectations.

**But that is not our reality**. Supper here was often a lot of yelling, sometimes only from one person, but it spread through everyone. Supper was often not peaceful. Supper was often a marathon. It took me years. Like until the past few weeks to undo this expectation. Because every good family is supposed to have supper together, right? Wrong. _If it's not working, then it's not working._ And I should've clued in way earlier.

## What does it look dinner time look like for us now?

It looks like my hubby usually cooking supper and I'm with the kids, one at a time. Once one kid is done eating, the next is up. And then they are sent off to play. The other adult not at the table is usually tidying up. _After letting go of that expectation_ of having supper together all at the same time, _there is a peace over our home now at supper time_. It's not perfect, no, but it's much, much better. And I'm SO grateful I was able to see it was my own expectation of having supper together that I was holding onto for so long.

PS Thank you to my friend Sara for reminding me that she staggers her kids at supper...you are my inspiration!
