Many people ask me why I changed my profession and what was my path. I would like to share my story and tips with wider community 🙂 

Python Developer / [DjangoGirlsWaw](https://www.facebook.com/DjangoGirlsWarsaw/) PyLight
 co-organiser / Green Roofs Enthusiast

I guess you might know this exciting feeling while discovering something new, interesting, which absorbs your attention till morning hours? Reading fantastic book, painting something that touches your heart or just watching breath-taking watching TV-series? 😁 This is what happened to me while creating green roofs map to my master thesis at Poznan University of Economics. I crossed the issue of moving my map from Google Maps to CartoDB. Data layers were based on Google's sattellite images. CartoDB had another geospatial source and the angles of photo shots were different. Not 'the same kind of vector' different but unlike to Google's in each place. 

![Front-end vs. Back-end](http://i.imgur.com/G7hDEvr.jpg){: style="float:right; width: 40%; height: auto;"}

This is when I met programming for the first time - to tranfer my layers automatically I had to use JavaScript. This is how my story begun. I started first tutorials and found out, that I totally enjoy doing these smaller and bigger 'logical puzzles'. Long story short, after some time I decided that I could be a full time programmer. 
First decision was: _Front-end or back-end - that is the question?_ 

In the beginning my friends (instead of one, whom I will mention soon 🙂), recommended me learning front-end. So I did, I watched video tutorials, finished some courses, started coding first websites. But there was 'not enough chemistry' between me and HTML&CSS. 

Then I turned to advice of one of my friends, Michał, who already recommended me to start with Python weeks before. And this was it, I felt enchanted with Python 🐍😄 I missed logical mind tricks, which I solved tons of between my primary and high school on Oddysey of the Mind classes. And I felt very similiar with Python - logical sequences exercising brain (especially in the beginning when everything is brand new). I took my very first steps to Codeacademy's [Learn Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) course. Then there was [Introduction to Programming with Python](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-us/training-courses/introduction-to-programming-with-python-8360?l=lqhuMxFz_8904984382), Code School's [Python & Django](https://www.codeschool.com/learn/python), CheckIO's [Python path](https://checkio.org/), [different tasks](http://www.practicepython.org/) from Practice Python. Then I started exercises preparing to Back-End Bootcamp in [CodersLab](https://coderslab.pl/pl). Main part of the programme were: Python, Django, MySQL, OOP, JavaScript and jQuery. This course speed up entering professional career path, it was very intensive
