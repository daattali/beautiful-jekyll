Making do vs. buying new and minimalism. Minimalism to me means being content with what I have and instead of clicking BUY NOW. I wait. And think. Can I borrow, find, thrift, or repurpose? I used to scoff at my father using peanut butter jars for paint or resusing milk bags for food storage. That's not what the cool kids do, right?! And alas, here I am, with years behind me and with four kids embracing the same. Reusability of items and making do. Thanks, dad. I finally listened. Today on the blog, I’m sharing about how to reuse ten items to save you money.

 1. The blog image above is my [protein powder container](https://amzn.to/2WjQBHt) in all its glory as a bathroom garbage can (on the counter no less because the toddler dumps out the garbage on the regular).
 2. Shampoo bottle for holding dish soap.
 3. [Kitty litter plastic bucket](https://amzn.to/3h1CvTk) for under the sink cleaning supply bucket.
 4. [Mason jars](https://amzn.to/3esjmZ0) given to use for water glasses.
 5. Scrap wood to make a pencil holder like [this](https://amzn.to/2Oq0gbq).
 6. Using leftover [jute](https://amzn.to/3071UEd) to make simple DIY macramé plant holders.
 7. [Empty spray bottles](https://amzn.to/3etWBDG) from old cleaning supplies to use for a veggie spray wash.
 8. Small cardboard boxes to use for sorting items.
 9. Leftover fabric to make cloth wipes.
10. Redoing a coffee table a friend gave us.

(Now tally up all that amount that I saved by not purchasing new...at least $200!).
