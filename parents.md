RMS Math Club activities at the school require parent proctor supervision. Proctors do not need to participate in coaching or prepare material.

Parent proctors need to be <a href="https://rmsptsa.org/Packet/Join" target="_blank">paid PTSA members</a> and also
<a href="https://www.lwsd.org/get-involved/volunteering-in-lwsd" target="_blank">LWSD approved volunteers</a>.
