Poster tier for FurSquared 2024 will be happening differently this year compared to the last few. There will be no lottery this year for FurSquared 2024. This year we’re happy to announce that for the 10th anniversary we will be taking in the first 100 that pay for “Poster”. No more waiting to see if you’re one of the lucky few instead you’ll know right away! Once all 100 slots have been paid FurSquared will announce on Twitter, Telegram, etc. on this page about all slots being filled.

If you found yourself already registered for FurSquared 2024 but did not select “Poster” as your registration level there’s good news for you. You will still be able to find the edit registration link in your email to upgrade to “Poster”. You will need to pay the difference between the level you purchased to Poster level in order to finalize your slot in our poster.

If you have any further questions about our poster this year please reach out to [poster@fursquared.com](mailto:poster@fursquared.com).

# Information Required for the Poster Tier
To participate in Fur Squared's 2024 poster, we need several details about the character to be drawn:

- Character name
- Description

Please share links to references, censoring is okay. Do not use discord links. Google drive links should be fine as long as they have permissions for anyone to view. Imgur might work too. We have limited time and cannot wait for emails to go back and forth, so please have links prepared for your character.

If a suitable reference is not submitted, then your registration level will be downgraded to Super Sponsor and you will be refunded the difference.
