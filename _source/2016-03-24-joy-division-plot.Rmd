title: ggplot2 and Joy Division
---

A while ago I had had a great time answering [a question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33619980/spread-out-density-plots-with-ggplot/33620860#33620860) on stackoverflow that was asking about recreating a plot from a [fivethirtyeight article](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-most-conservative-and-most-liberal-elite-law-schools/?ex_cid=538twitter) in ggplot2. You can see the original and my attempt below. I was satisfied with the style, but felt a bit dirty introducing a `for` loop.

Recreating other well known data visualisations is a reasonably common challenge for people who are into that sort of thing (see all the different recreations of Minard's famous figure, some of them collected [here](http://www.datavis.ca/gallery/re-minard.php)).

Working through the fivethirtyeight example above, I realised that it was a very similar approach to the iconic [Joy Division album sleeve from Unknown Pleasures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknown_Pleasures), apparently from a visualisation of data from radio pulses, and quite possibly the most famous figure from a PhD thesis ([more back story](http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/the-story-behind-joy-divisions-iconic-iunknown-pleasuresi-album-cover)).

Anyway, after a quick search I was really surprised that I couldn't find anyone recreating this figure in ggplot2, so I thought I'd give it a go. In the end I think I spent the most time trying to generate data that approximately similar to the original, and I'm not entirely satisfied, so please let me know if you can do a better job!

```{r setupOptions, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path = "../figure/", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
library(dplyr)
library(broom)
library(ggplot2)
```

Firstly to generate some data that somewhat reflects the original, which seems to be made up of multiple distributions + a whole lot of noise:

```{r make_data}

set.seed(1234)

j1 <- data.frame(Group = 1:50, 
                 n1 = sample(c(500, 1000, 2500, 5000), 50, TRUE, c(0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.3)),
                 n2 = sample(c(200, 400, 500, 1000), 50, TRUE, prob = c(0.3, 0.5, 0.15, 0.05)),
                 m1 = runif(50, -1, 1),
                 m2 = rnorm(50, 5, 0.5),
                 sd1 = sample(c(0.7, 1.5, 2.5), 50, TRUE, prob = c(0.15, 0.5, 0.35)),
                 sd2 = sample(c(0.7, 1, 3.5), 50, TRUE, prob = c(0.05, 0.6, 0.35)))
j2 <- j1 %>% 
  group_by(Group) %>% 
  do(x = c(rnorm(.$n1, .$m1, .$sd1), rnorm(.$n2, .$m2, .$sd2))) %>% 
  tidy(x)
```

I'm fairly certain there would be neater ways to do this, if you've got a better idea, let me know...

```{r more_data_work}

j3 <- j2 %>% 
  mutate(GroupNum = rev(as.numeric(Group))) %>% 
  group_by(Group, GroupNum) %>% 
  do(tidy(density(.$x, n = 100))) %>% 
  group_by() %>% 
  mutate(ymin = GroupNum * (max(y) / 10), #This constant controls how much overlap between groups there is
         ymax = y + ymin)

j4 <- j3 %>% 
  group_by(Group, GroupNum) %>% 
  do(data.frame(approx(.$x, .$ymax, xout = seq(min(j3$x), max(j3$x), length.out = 250)))) %>% 
  mutate(y = ifelse(is.na(y), j3$ymin[j3$Group == Group][1], y),
         ymin = j3$ymin[j3$Group == Group][1],
         ymaxN = y + rnorm(n(), 0.001, 0.005)) %>% 
  arrange(x) %>% 
  mutate(ymaxN = ifelse(row_number() %in% c(1, n()), ymin + min(ymaxN - ymin), ymaxN))

j4$ymaxS <- smooth(j4$ymaxN, kind = "S", endrule = "copy", do.ends = FALSE)
```

Again, I'm sure there are neater ways to do this, but I ended up doing my own density estimation to be able to use `geom_ribbon`, since the plot is essentially `geom_density` but removed from the x axis. As stated above, I really don't feel comfortable with the `for`, but couldn't figure a way to map to a grouping in this context.

```{r make_plot}
p <- ggplot()
for (i in rev(unique(j4$GroupNum))) {
  p <- p + geom_ribbon(data = j4[j4$GroupNum == i,], aes(x = x, ymin = ymin + min(j4$ymaxN - j4$ymin), ymax = ymaxS, group = GroupNum), colour = "#F0F0F0", fill = "black") +
    geom_hline(yintercept = j4$ymin[j4$GroupNum == i][1] + min(j4$ymaxN - j4$ymin), colour = "#000000")
}
p <- p + 
  coord_fixed(13) +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
          panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#000000"),
          axis.text = element_blank(),
          axis.ticks = element_blank(),
          axis.title = element_blank())
```

And the final result:

```{r print_plot, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
print(p)
```

While I'm certainly not getting it [tattooed on my back](http://ajournalofmusicalthings.com/an-epic-joy-division-tattoo/), I'm reasonably satisfied with the end result.
