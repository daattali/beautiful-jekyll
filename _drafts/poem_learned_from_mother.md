 **What I Learned From My Mother**    
Julia Kasdorf   
   
I learned from my mother how to love   
the living, to have plenty of vases on hand   
in case you have to rush to the hospital   
with peonies cut from the lawn, black ants   
still stuck to the buds. I learned to save jars   
large enough to hold fruit salad for a whole   
grieving household, to cube home-canned pears   
and peaches, to slice through maroon grape skins   
and flick out the sexual seeds with a knife point.   
I learned to attend viewings even if I didn’t know   
the deceased, to press the moist hands   
of the living, to look in their eyes and offer   
sympathy, as though I understood loss even then.   
I learned that whatever we say means nothing,   
what anyone will remember is that we came.   
I learned to believe I had the power to ease   
awful pains materially like an angel.   
Like a doctor, I learned to create   
from another’s suffering my own usefulness, and once   
you know how to do this, you can never refuse.   
To every house you enter, you must offer   
healing: a chocolate cake you baked yourself,   
the blessing of your voice, your chaste touch.
