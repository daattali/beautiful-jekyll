 1. That in the long run, it is always easier and faster to take the time to do things the right way. 
2. There's always going to be at least one person (usually more) who bitches about everything. Stay away from them, they will drain the life from you.
3. Take the time to get a feel for your coworkers and don't align yourself with any one group right away.
4. Be wary of the person who wants to share all the office gossip with you on the first day.
