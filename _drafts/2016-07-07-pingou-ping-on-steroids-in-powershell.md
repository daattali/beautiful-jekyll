title: 'Pingou: ping on steroids in powershell'
---
Pingou is a powershell script that allows to test connectivity with ICMP and open ports with TCP. This command is meant to be easy to use, intuitive and faster than the built in test-connection and test-netconnection.

I took inspiration on a great script that one of my colleagues wrote "[tPing](http://www.nimbus117.co.uk/powershell/2015/07/06/tPing.html)". But because there is no better way to learn than to do it myself I took a few ideas and wrote mine from scratch.
