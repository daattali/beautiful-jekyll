A couple of years ago I used to work for 9 hours at work and 4 hours on my side project at night for 4 months. My wife supported me. One day she said we hadn't been able to talk like a couple for months, what did I think about my role in our family. At first, I denied that it's an issue. I just really enjoyed working and thinking I was creating value. But what value am I really creating if my life and my family is screwed up?

So it's great that you already see that you need to stop doing it. 

Think through these questions and feel free to reply here so I can customize the advice for you:

\- What do you fear that drives you to work non-stop?

\- What do you envision the role you'll play in your family? What's the image of an ideal husband in your mind?

\- Are you willing to do what it takes to control your life, instead of being controlled by your instinct or things that make you feel good?
Fantastic. You already know a lot about yourself!

Let me start by saying that your feelings are healthy and normal. Everyone has this challenge. Everyone has to figure this out either by reading, by mentorship, or by experience, at some point of their lives.

A key concept I want to introduce first is: "wrong ideas do not equal to a wrong person". Before we build our own philosophical system, we all accept concepts and ideas from other people. A lot of them are outdated because as our society evolves, old ideas no longer apply, but they are being taught anyways. We all have them. I'd like to point out some wrong ideas you may have taken in. But by no means am I trying to imply that you are wrong. To say a person is wrong is as terrible as saying "you do not deserve to live". In the old tribal days, those who have different ideas are executed or exiled. That's why we are so sensitive about being told wrong. Really what I'd like to explain below are some BETTER ways of thinking about work and life for today's world.

Imagine you are driving a car, and all it has is the gas pedal. No brake pedal. Is it a car you ever want to drive? Is it a good car?

Which do you agree more: life is a sprint, or life is a marathon?

You already know the answer, but you haven't changed how you behave yet. It means you haven't fully thought it through. Because if you fully understand how life works, it only takes a second to change your behavior. Just like when you know you are running a marathon, you will not start as if it's a 100m race and use all your strength in 10 seconds.

I think your biggest fear is not meeting the expectation from your parents and most importantly, yourself. Doing well academically is the best way to meet parents' expectations. Most people in our parents' generations expect their children to live a SECURE life because they lived in a world of post-war where everything was a bit scarce. You mentioned "risk-averse" so I assume you've got some influence from your parents. It's not wrong to be risk-averse. But the risk doesn't go away if you choose to do just what you are expected to do. With A.I. replacing so many jobs now, how do you know your skills today will not be useless tomorrow? When you decide to stay safe you've already made a bet on one side of the table. Every action or inaction has an opportunity cost, no matter you acknowledge it or not.

I am not saying you should throw away all the knowledge and experience you've gained today and go in a completely different direction. That doesn't make sense either. But you got to keep your option open for continuing to learn new skills and new mindsets - by reading and by doing.

It must have been a hard time when your dad lost his job, but there is nothing illustrates the reality more clearly about today's world. There are so many opportunities out there in the last few decades that the governments assume everyone should be able to seize some and make a living. That's why there are so many entrepreneurs and startups because people realize the old security is gone and no longer exists. I think it should be a wake-up call for you that you should adopt a different mindset and acquire a new skill every 2 - 5 years to stay competitive in the job market.

What kind of employees do employers value most? Those who get the job done, sure. You work hard and you get the job done. That's awesome but not enough. Employers value those who are competitive in the job market because for a company to stay competitive, it needs employees who are familiar with the state-of-art of the industry. Those people reserved time for learning instead of working.

\----

All this leads to one conclusion: you need to learn new skills. It will ease your anxiety about the existential crisis and the problem of working not growing. And to learn new skills you need to make time for it. To make time for it you need detachment from your current work. If you are a loyal person, it might feel weird, but it doesn't really conflict. When employers have to layoff employees, they don't really care about loyalty.

What I have found was when I am working on non-challenging problems, i.e. when I am applying what I already know to problems I've solved thousands of times, I am not adding value to myself. It doesn't make me more competitive in any way.  So I either would switch to a different company or will finish work early and go home to learn something new.

If you are afraid of doing what's not scripted will scare your parents or your wife, you've got to first verify if that's what they really will feel. I used to think quitting my job or joining a startup would scare my mom because I felt she never supported me, (which was not true, but I still felt so). When I told her she was like: "Oh, great, give it a try. Tell your current boss you appreciate their help and finish your work before you leave". It was a big relief. It was my self-doubt that got me to think I needed to play safe. So I encourage you to really find support by laying out your plan with those you care first, not blind support.

\----

Lastly, happy wife, happy life. She also only has one life and her time is as valuable as yours. Don't let her constantly wait for you to solve your own problems first. Balance life, learning, and work and you will be much happier. But take baby steps.
