What employers fail to understand is that efficiency comes with independence and freedom. Quality comes with a tension-free, cool, and calm mind. The biggest misconception that these self-proclaimed, extraordinarily, smart people have, is the belief that sticking on to a chair all day is the biggest trait of an excellent employee.

Employees are not bonded labour, they are not slaves.
