 Very wise indeed. My current job is 100% shit aside from decent salary (unfair treatment, high turnover rate, ridiculous meetings, no proper training, confusing instructions, annoying and micromanaging boss, not much opportunities) but I'm staying until March at least while I passively search for a new job. If I get out here early it will be my loss reputation/money/career-wise while my boss can continue being a spawn of satan and burn my other coworkers and newcomers freely as they have nothing much to lose.

I have already conditioned myself that I'll be in hell until the next year, I even reread Dante's Inferno during my free time.
