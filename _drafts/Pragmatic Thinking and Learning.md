systems thinking, one tries to envision an object as a connection point of several systems, rather than as a discrete object unto itself.

it’s easy to get so swamped under the daily demands of our jobs that we have no chance to advance our careers.

We can’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.

novices need clear, context-free rules by which they can operate,

Novices don’t particularly want to learn; they just want to accomplish an immediate goal. They do not know how to respond to mistakes and so are fairly vulnerable to confusion when things go awry.

Novices need recipes.

Advanced beginners don’t want the big picture.

Competents can troubleshoot.

Proficient practitioners can self-correct.

Also, they can learn from the experience of others.

Experts work from intuition, not from reason.

The expert is very good at targeted, focused pattern matching.

This lack of accurate self-assessment is referred to as second-order incompetence, that is, the condition of being unskilled and unaware of it.

Rules ruin experts.

Agile development is a very effective tool, but it won’t work on a team composed solely of novices and advanced beginners.

“Practices can never be completely objectified or formalized because they must ever be worked out anew in particular relationships and in real time.”

Most people are advanced beginners.

just because you are expert in some subject is no guarantee that you can teach it to others.

expert’s intuition and pattern recognition now take the place of explicit knowledge.

secret to learning music was to go through three phases: 
• Imitate 
• Assimilate 
• Innovate

There’s no expertise without experience, and there’s no substitute for experience—but we can work to make the experience you have more efficient and more effective.

what is the value they bring to the organization?

winners don’t carry losers—losers get cut from the team.

Confusing the model with reality

Devaluing traits that cannot be formalized

Legislating behavior that contradicts individual autonomy

Alienating experienced practitioners in favor of novices

Spelling out too much detail

Oversimplification of complex situations

Demand for excessive conformity

Insensitivity to contextual nuances

Confusion between following rules and exercising judgment

Mystification

There is an inherent danger in decontextualized objectivity, that is, in trying to be objective about something after taking it out of its context.

Novices need quick successes and context-free rules.

Not only is there a time delay from the original thought to your awareness of it, but there is no central locus of thought in the brain.

Capture all ideas to get more of them.

The fastest processing modes are the muscle-memory sorts of responses that don’t even travel up to the cortex itself.[36]

many very valid thought processes are not rational, including intuition,

just because a thought process is nonrational or nonrepeatable doesn’t mean it is unscientific, irresponsible, or inappropriate in any way.

attractive user interfaces are easier to use than unattractive (or to use the scientific term, ugly) interfaces.

positive emotions are essential to learning and creative thinking. Being

One study at Duke University[45] showed that brief exposure to the Apple logo made people more creative.

in a rich environment with things to learn, observe, and interact with, you will grow plenty of new neurons and new connections between them.

“Design is not making beauty; beauty emerges from selection, affinities, integration, love.”

And selection—knowing what to select and in what context—comes from pattern matching,

This experiment seems to amplify the fact that if you’re looking for global, holistic patterns, you need R-mode. If you need to analyze parts and look into the detail, then you need a more L-mode approach.

Just thinking that your brain has more capacity for learning makes it so.

Skills and abilities that you constantly use and constantly practice will begin to dominate, and more of your brain will become wired for those purposes.

Add sensory experience to engage more of your brain.

Use cross-sensory feedback.
• Write it down in your usual form. 
• Draw a picture (not UML or an official diagram; just a picture). What visual metaphor is appropriate? 
• Describe it verbally. 
• Engage in open discussion with your teammates; respond to questions and criticisms, and so on. 
• Act out the roles involved. (Any physical metaphors come to mind? We’ll talk a lot about metaphors shortly.)

To access the perceptual R-mode of the brain, it’s necessary to present the brain with a job that the verbal, analytic L-mode will turn down.

He first presented us with a multisensory, experiential context so that we could “get our heads around it,” as it were. Then he followed up with a more traditional, fact-filled lecture.

Lead with R-mode; follow with L-mode.

Just as creativity can be stifled by trying to tie ideas down prematurely, learning can be impeded by trying to memorize minor facts when you don’t yet grasp the whole.

perfectionism is based on the obsessive belief that if you run carefully enough, hitting each stepping-stone just right, you won’t have to die. The truth is that you will die anyway and that a lot of people who aren’t even looking at their feet are going to do a whole lot better than you, and have a lot more fun while they’re doing it.”

Use metaphor as the meeting place between L-mode and R-mode.

Use random juxtaposition to create metaphor.
The further away the ideas are, the harder it is to join them in a metaphor that works.

system metaphor. The idea is that any software system should be able to be guided by an appropriate metaphor.

“Metaphorical thinking is fundamental in programming, as it is in all abstract thought. When we aren’t aware of our metaphors, we can lead ourselves astray.

skewed connection makes it funny.

extend an existing idea past what’s reasonable.

Many ideas are not verbalizable.

Image streaming is a technique designed to help harvest R-mode imagery.[62] The basic idea is to deliberately observe mental imagery: pay close attention to it, and work it around in your mind a bit.

Another simple way of harvesting your R-mode’s preconscious treasures is to write.

Write your morning pages first thing in the morning—before your coffee, before the traffic report, before talking to Mr. Showerhead, before packing the kids off to school or letting the dog out. 
• Write at least three pages, long hand. No typing, no computer. 
• Do not censor what you write. Whether it’s brilliant or banal, just let it out. 
• Do not skip a day.

As soon as you focus on a goal, L-mode processes will dominate, and that’s not what you want here. Instead, you want to cultivate a style of non-goal-directed thinking.

Code is write-once, read-many.

But advanced beginners may begin to push back, complaining that spending time on code layout is a waste of time. Proficients and experts will bristle at poor code if it’s harder for them to see the patterns they’re used to seeing, whatever those may be.

Typography has a powerful impact on perception—for better or for worse.

instead of trying to prevent a difficult-to-find bug, try coming up with three to four ways to deliberately cause it.

Necessity is the mother of invention. Play is the father of invention.

This technique, known as a functional shift, causes a sudden peak in brain activity. 
Because it’s an unexpected input, the brain has to do some work to figure out the full meaning.

We’ll look at four broad categories of problems: 
• Cognitive biases: How your thinking can be led astray 
• Generational affinity: How your peers influence you 
• Personality tendencies: How your personality influences your thoughts 
• Hardware bugs: How older portions of your brain can override the smarter portions

Anchoring
Just seeing a number will affect how you then predict or decide some quantity.

Fundamental attribution error
We tend to ascribe other people’s behavior to their personality, instead of looking at the situation and the context in which their behavior occurs.

Self-serving bias
This is the tendency to believe that if the project is a success, I’m responsible. If it tanked, then I’m not.

Need for closure

Artificially declaring a decision, such as the end date of a project, doesn’t remove the inherent uncertainty; it just masks it.

Confirmation bias
Everyone looks for choice facts to fit your own preconceptions and pet theories.

Exposure effect
We tend to prefer things just because they are familiar.

Hawthorne effect
Researchers have noticed that people have a tendency to change their behaviors when they know they are being studied.

False memory
It’s actually pretty easy for your brain to confuse imagined events with real memories.

Symbolic reduction fallacy
As we saw earlier, L-mode is anxious to provide a quick symbol to represent a complex object or system, which loses at least the nuances

Nominal fallacy
A kind of symbolic reduction problem; this is the idea that labeling a thing means you can explain it or understand it.

a group, we tend to miss important developments because we’re focused on the wrong thing or are asking the wrong questions.

Just because two variables are correlated does not mean that either causes the other.

The black swan cautions us not to discount unobserved or rare phenomena as impossible.

you want to defer closure for as long as possible in order to make a better decision later.

For something you don’t know but that has to be known by others, such as a go-live date, you can express it as a “target” date along with an indication of your confidence in the estimate.

Trust ink over memory; every mental read is a write.

You are a product of your times—perhaps much more so than you think. The attitudes, philosophies, and values of your parents and your cohort (those born about the same time as you; your peers throughout school and in the workplace; members of your generation) have a tremendous impact on your values, attitudes, and perceptions.

Here are the four generational archetypes and their dominant characteristics: 
• Prophet: Vision, values 
• Nomad: Liberty, survival, honor 
• Hero: Community, affluence 
• Artist: Pluralism, expertise, due process

Not everyone shares your deep-seated values, and that doesn’t mean you’re right or they’re wrong.

The best way to keep from falling victim to your generation’s particular set of biases is to embrace diversity.

Allow for different bugs in different people.

Here’s how to act like a lizard: 
Fight, flight, or fright

Get it now

Be dominant

Defend the territory

“The mind is its own place and, in itself, can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven.” —John Milton, Paradise Lost.

But Internet time short-circuits the neocortex and exposes our reptilian responses. It allows you to fully vent your initial visceral reaction, whether it’s in an email, a blog comment, or an IM. Although that fast, violent reaction might be a fine thing when faced with a predator in the jungle, it’s less helpful when trying to collaborate on a project

Expectations color reality.

your ability to learn may be your most important element of success. It’s what separates getting ahead from just getting by.

Learning isn’t done to you; it’s something you do. 
• Mastering knowledge alone, without experience, isn’t effective. 
• A random approach, without goals and feedback, tends to give random results.

A single intense, out-of-context classroom event can only get you started in the right direction, at best. You need continuing goals, you need to get feedback to understand your progress, and you need to approach the whole thing far more deliberately than a once-a-year course in a stuffy classroom.

SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-boxed.

A goal or objective that you cannot attain is not a target; it’s just a maddening, soul-sucking frustration.

Your objectives have to make sense in the larger context, which might include the following: 
• Family 
• Business 
• Financial 
• Community 
• Environment 
This extends the ideas of attainability and relevance.

knowledge portfolio. That is, the skills you learn and the knowledge you master all become part of your portfolio. And like any portfolio—financial or artistic—it must be managed as time goes by.

relegating learning activities to your “free time” is a recipe for failure.

For instance: 
• Now (what’s the next action you can take) 
• Goals for next year 
• Goals for five years out

the planning is far more important than the plan. The plan will change, as we’ll see next. But getting in tune with your goals is invaluable.

One major difference between knowledge investments and financial investments is that all knowledge investments have some value.

Just because you spend a lot of time doing something doesn’t mean that it’s adding value to your knowledge portfolio.

PIP: Active, Not Passive, Investment
Another main topic from The Pragmatic Programmer is the idea of feedback. In this case, you want to always evaluate your plan in the cold light of day and realistically judge how it’s going.

PIP: Invest Regularly (Dollar-Cost Averaging)
Finally, you need to invest regularly. In financial terms, this lets you do dollar-cost averaging. That means that if you buy stock on a regular basis, sometimes you’ll pay too much, and sometimes you’ll get a great deal. But over the long-term, these differences smooth out, and in general you end up getting a good bargain.

Get the planning out of the way before you get there so that when you have your time, you can get right to it.

two theories based on cognitive context emerged: Robert Sternberg’s triarchic theory and Howard Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences.

Survey: Scan the table of contents and chapter summaries for an overview. 
• Question: Note any questions you have. 
• Read: Read in its entirety. 
• Recite: Summarize, take notes, and put in your own words. 
• Review: Reread, expand notes, and discuss with colleagues.

When creating a mind map, avoid filling in the elements in a clockwise manner—that’s just an outline going in circles.

Hand-writing is key, whether it’s plain notes or a mind map.

Producing low-level design documents that simply mirror the code (and become obsolete almost immediately) don’t provide any value to anyone.

“Chance favors only the prepared mind,”

taking notes seems to be very important, even if you never read them again.

Make a screencast.

See it. Do it. Teach it.

Their approach is called constructivism: we build to learn, not learn to build.

“playful behavior.” 
That doesn’t mean that it’s easy, non-business-like, or not effective.

the Dreyfus model is a model per skill, not per person. The world isn’t filled with smart people and dumb people; it’s filled with smart lab researchers and dumb drivers, smart cooks and dumb politicians.

Try mind-size bites.

Learn from similarities; unlearn from differences.

Debugging means solving problems, generally of our own making.

“I don’t know” is a fine answer, but don’t let it end there.

An efficient, supportive learning environment should allow you to do three things, safely: explore, invent, and apply.

Whether it’s on a corporate team or a solo experiment in the dark watches of the night, you need the following:

Freedom to experiment

Ability to backtrack to a stable state

Reproduce any work product as of any time

Ability to demonstrate progress

In software development, it’s pretty simple to set up an infrastructure to address these needs. It’s what we call the Starter Kit: version control, unit testing, and project automation.

we learn better by discovery, not instruction.

Situational feedback is the primary inner game technique that allows you to learn more efficiently by eliminating any interference.

Awareness is an important tool in becoming more than a novice.

This is a key aspect to playing the inner game: don’t focus on correcting individual details, but just be aware. Accept what is as a first step, and just be aware of it. Don’t judge, don’t rush in with a solution, don’t criticize.

Be fully aware of how the system is behaving, and only then decide what part of that is “wrong” before moving on to devise a solution.

The next time you find yourself trapped in an ad hoc hack-spin-loop, try it. The idea is to raise your awareness; explicitly contrasting your imagined version of the code with the real code helps accomplish that.

The mere presence of a looming deadline can panic the mind into failure.

a time pressure “hangover.” Your creativity suffers on the day you’re under the gun and remains depressed for the next two days as well.

permission to fail leads to success.

A “brainstorming” session where ideas get shot down as soon as they’re uttered has the same debilitating effect.

turns out that your brain isn’t very good at discriminating between input sources. Real-time sensor data, memories of past events, and even imagined circumstances that haven’t happened all result in the same physiological responses

Much of perception is based on prediction,[130] and prediction is based on context and past experience, so much so that current, real-time input takes a backseat.

In other words, by surrounding yourself with highly skilled people, you will increase your own skill level. Some of that is from observation and application of their practices and approaches. Some of that comes from the fact that you’re conditioning your mind to perform at a higher level. You have a natural mechanism known as mirror neurons that help: watching someone else’s behavior triggers an equivalence for you to do the same.

Getting used to what “success” feels like is important enough that it’s worthwhile to fake it first.

You can go the other way as well, by using negative scaffolding, or unscaffolding, if you will. That’s when you make it artificially harder than it should be. Then when you’re doing it for real, it seems a lot easier.

the overabundance of information has resulted in a poverty of knowledge and attention.

Information is raw data in a given context.

Knowledge imparts meaning to that information.

Context, beyond the usage we’ve seen so far, is the set of stuff you are focused on at the moment.

Similarly, it’s easy for us humans to divide our attention fecklessly such that nothing receives our full attention and so nothing effective gets done.

L-mode CPU has a sort of “idle loop” routine.

It’s not that we’re out of time; we’re out of attention.

intensive mental training can produce lasting and significant improvements in the efficient distribution of attentional resources among competing stimuli, even when individuals are not actively using the techniques they have learned.”

Aim for relaxed awareness.

There is no single source or executive monitor that’s calling the shots. Instead, whichever areas are activated together right now form your consciousness. That makes consciousness a bottom-up, self-organizing, perhaps even emergent property.

In general, if you can’t think of three ways a plan can go wrong or think of three different solutions to a problem, then you haven’t thought it through enough.

A wiki feels like a text-based mind map

multitasking can cost you 20 to 40 percent of your productivity.

cognitive overload.

One way to help fight this is to approach context switching more deliberately

Set up certain times of the day as work sessions where you are not to be interrupted. Set up other times for collaboration, daily stand-up meetings,

Does the anticipatory stress of email affect your breathing? How about a program crash or tracing through a debugger? Or any other common scenario on the computer? 
If you find any of these affect your breathing, just sit back and take a deep breath. Every time.

Make the cost obvious.

IM follows the same dynamic—don’t answer if you’re busy. Call them back when you are ready so you don’t lose all the context you’ve laboriously assembled.

There are two time periods of interest: the interruption lag and the resumption lag.

cue preparation.

You can instantly realize productivity gains of 20 to 30 percent just by getting yourself a second monitor, regardless of how you measure productivity.

Use virtual desktops.

Keep track of “down” vs. “thinking” time; take care not to confuse the two.

Practice may not make perfect, but it sure makes permanent.

Start with a plan.

Inaction is the enemy, not error.

New habits take time.

Belief is real.

Take small, next steps.

Approach learning without preconceived notions, prior judgment, or a fixed viewpoint.

Vermeer challenges the girl to see the world as he sees it: full of marvelous complexity and rich, subtle nuances. That’s the challenge we all face—to see the world that way and to continue to see that world—and ourselves—fully.
