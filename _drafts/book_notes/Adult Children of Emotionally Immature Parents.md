Internalizers may even feel emotionally nurtured as they resonate with the beauty of nature or art.

Externalizers also have needs for emotional comforting, but they tend to force such needs on other people, taking others emotionally hostage with their reactivity.

Externalizers who get very upset may look like they have a strong drive toward emotional engagement, but their approach is more like panicking than connecting. It takes a lot to calm them, and even then they still seem vaguely mistrustful and dissatisfied because they aren’t open to connecting fully. Trying to calm an upset externalizer is an unsatisfying experience for both people, as the person providing comfort has no sense of truly helping.

Given that emotional connection is powerful enough to support people through catastrophic events, think what it can do for ordinary daily coping.

self-contained internalizers do seem to get by on less attention; but this doesn’t mean they can get by on emotional neglect.

They just said generic things, like ‘Oh, you’re going to be fine,’ ‘It’s going to be okay,’ or ‘There’s no need to feel that way; you’ll feel better soon.’”

Internalizers put a lot of emotional work into their family relationships.

internalizing children may take on a cheerful, lighthearted role, trying to bring happiness and liveliness into an otherwise somber family climate. With their liveliness and good sense of humor, they help others feel that things aren’t so bad.

family systems theory (1978), which describes how emotionally immature parents promote emotional enmeshment over individual identity.

enmeshment occurs when parents don’t respect boundaries, project their unresolved issues onto their children, and get too involved in their children’s business.

Further, in an enmeshed family, if you have a problem with someone, you talk about that person to other people instead of going to the person directly. Bowen called this triangling and characterized enmeshment as the glue that keeps such families together.

During a stressful interaction, this kind of mental narration can center and ground you.

Being Willing to Ask for Help


• • I’ll ask for help whenever I need to. 
• • I’ll remind myself that if I need something, most people will be glad to help if they can. 
• • I’ll use clear, intimate communication to ask for what I want, explaining my feelings and the reasons for my request. 
• • I’ll trust that most people will listen if I ask them to. 


Being Myself, Whether People Accept Me or Not


• • When I state my thoughts clearly and politely, without malice, I won’t try to control how people take it. 
• • I won’t give more energy than I really have. 
• • Instead of trying to please, I’ll give other people a true indication of how I feel. 
• • I won’t volunteer for something if I think I’ll resent it later. 
• • If someone says something I find offensive, I’ll offer an alternative viewpoint. I won’t try to change the other person’s mind; I just won’t let the statement go unremarked upon. 


Sustaining and Appreciating Emotional Connections


• • I’ll make a point of keeping in touch with special people I care about and returning their calls or electronic messages. 
• • I’ll think of myself as a strong person who deserves to give and receive help from my community of friends. 
• • Even when people aren’t saying the “right” thing, I’ll tune in to whether they’re trying to help me. If their effort makes me feel emotionally nurtured, I’ll express my gratitude. 
• • When I’m irritated with someone, I’ll think about what I want to say that could improve our relationship. I’ll wait until I cool off and then ask if the other person is willing to listen to my feelings. 


Having Reasonable Expectations for Myself


• • I’ll keep in mind that being perfect isn’t always necessary. I’ll get stuff done rather than obsess over getting things done perfectly. 
• • When I get tired, I’ll rest or do something different. My level of physical energy will tell me when I’ve been doing too much. I won’t wait for an accident or illness to make me stop. 
• • When I make a mistake, I’ll chalk it up to being human. Even if I think I’ve anticipated everything, there will be outcomes I don’t expect. 
• • I’ll remember that everyone is responsible for their own feelings and for expressing their needs clearly. Beyond common courtesy, it isn’t up to me to guess what others want. 


Communicating Clearly and Actively Seeking the Outcomes I Want


• • I won’t expect people to know what I need unless I tell them. Caring about me doesn’t mean they automatically know what I’m feeling. 
• • If people close to me upset me, I’ll use my pain to identify my underlying need. Then I’ll use clear, intimate communication to provide guidance on how they could give it to me.

• • I’ll be thoughtful to other people, and if they aren’t thoughtful in return, I’ll ask them to be more considerate and then let it go. 
• • I’ll ask for something as many times as it takes to get a clear answer. 
• • When I get tired of interacting, I’ll politely speak up, asking if we can continue our contact at another time. I’ll explain kindly that I’m just out of gas at the moment.
