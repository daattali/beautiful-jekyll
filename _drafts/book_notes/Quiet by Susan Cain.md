“It’s so easy to confuse schmoozing ability with talent.

introverts are uniquely good at leading initiative-takers.

Extroverts, on the other hand, can be so intent on putting their own stamp on events that they risk losing others’ good ideas along the way and allowing workers to lapse into passivity.

College students who tend to study alone learn more over time than those who work in groups.

Deliberate Practice is best conducted alone for several reasons. It takes intense concentration, and other people can be distracting. It requires deep motivation, often self-generated. But most important, it involves working on the task that’s most challenging to you personally.

That’s because top performers overwhelmingly worked for companies that gave their workers the most privacy, personal space, control over their physical environments, and freedom from interruption.

simple act of being interrupted is one of the biggest barriers to productivity.

But he prefers passive forms of collaboration like e-mail, instant messaging, and online chat tools.

If personal space is vital to creativity, so is freedom from “peer pressure.”

performance gets worse as group size increases:

exception to this is online brainstorming.

group brainstorming makes people feel attached. A worthy goal, so long as we understand that social glue, as opposed to creativity, is the principal benefit.

social loafing:

only one person can talk or produce an idea at once,

evaluation apprehension

the conformists showed less brain activity in the frontal, decision-making regions and more in the areas of the brain associated with perception. Peer pressure, in other words, is not only unpleasant, but can actually change your view of a problem.

“the pain of independence,”

adolescent girls with the short allele of the SERT gene are 20 percent more likely to be depressed than long-allele girls when exposed to stressful family environments, but 25 percent less likely to be depressed when raised in stable homes. Similarly, short allele adults have been shown to have more anxiety in the evening than others when they’ve had stressful days,

introverts are more sensitive than extroverts to various kinds of stimulation,

introversion and extroversion as preferences for certain levels of stimulation, you can begin consciously trying to situate yourself in environments favorable to your own personality—

Overarousal interferes with attention and short-term memory

There is no one more courageous than the person who speaks with the courage of his convictions.

reward-sensitive, while the introverts are more likely to pay attention to warning signals.

The old brain and the new brain do work together, but not always efficiently.

(DRD4) associated with a particularly thrill-seeking version of extroversion is a strong predictor of financial risk-taking. By contrast, people with a variant of a serotonin-regulating gene linked to introversion and sensitivity take 28 percent less financial risk than others.

it was forceful extroverts who caused the global financial crash.

introverts are “geared to inspect” and extroverts “geared to respond.”

“When a person bids up too high,” he told me, “that’s because they didn’t inhibit a response they should have inhibited. They didn’t consider information that should have been weighing on their decision.”

Extroverts are more likely to take a quick-and-dirty approach to problem-solving, trading accuracy for speed, making increasing numbers of mistakes as they go, and abandoning ship altogether when the problem seems too difficult or frustrating. Introverts think before they act, digest information thoroughly, stay on task longer, give up less easily, and work more accurately.

we tend to overvalue buzz and discount the risks of reward-sensitivity:

anticipating rewards—any rewards, whether or not related to the subject at hand—excites our dopamine-driven reward networks

If you are reward-oriented:


1. When I get something I want, I feel excited and energized.


2. When I want something, I usually go all out to get it.


3. When I see an opportunity for something I like, I get excited right away.


4. When good things happen to me, it affects me strongly.


5. I have very few fears compared to my friends.



If you are threat-oriented:


1. Criticism or scolding hurts me quite a bit.


2. I feel pretty worried or upset when I think or know somebody is angry at me.


3. If I think something unpleasant is going to happen, I usually get pretty “worked up.”


4. I feel worried when I think I have done poorly at something important.


5. I worry about making mistakes.

Flow often occurs, he writes, in conditions in which people “become independent of the social environment to the degree that they no longer respond exclusively in terms of its rewards and punishments.

your biggest challenge may be to fully harness your strengths.

If you like to do things in a slow and steady way, don’t let others make you feel as if you have to race.

The trick for introverts is to honor their own styles instead of allowing themselves to be swept up by prevailing norms.

“Once you have ordinary intelligence, what you need is the temperament to control the urges that get other people into trouble in investing.”

classrooms. One professor noted a “deference barrier” created by Asian students’ reverence for their teachers.

“The Americans emphasize sociability and prize those attributes that make for easy, cheerful association. The Chinese emphasize deeper attributes, focusing on moral virtues and achievement.”

Individuals in Asia see themselves as part of a greater whole—whether family, corporation, or community—and place tremendous value on harmony within their group. They often subordinate their own desires to the group’s interests, accepting their place in its hierarchy.


Western culture, by contrast, is organized around the individual.

“When people do things like that, there’s a moment where I feel uncomfortable with it. It shows my own limits. Sometimes I feel like they’re better than I am.”

For Asian-American kids, the cost of failing to fit in is social unease. But as they grow up, they may pay the price with their paychecks.

Aggressive power beats you up; soft power wins you over.”

Gandhi’s passivity was not weakness at all. It meant focusing on an ultimate goal and refusing to divert energy to unnecessary skirmishes along the way.

A man has as many social selves as there are distinct groups of persons about whose opinion he cares. He generally shows a different side of himself to each of these different groups.

Do fixed personality traits really exist, or do they shift according to the situation in which people find themselves?

Erving Goffman, author of The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life, suggested that social life is performance and social masks are our true selves.

People who are “rejection-sensitive” are warm and loving when they feel secure, hostile and controlling when they feel rejected.

According to Free Trait Theory, we are born and culturally endowed with certain personality traits—introversion, for example—but we can and do act out of character in the service of “core personal projects.”

if we act out of character by convincing ourselves that our pseudo-self is real, we can eventually burn out without even knowing why.

behavioral leakage, in which our true selves seep out via unconscious body language:

Self-monitors are highly skilled at modifying their behavior to the social demands of a situation.

I’m doing this to advance work I care about deeply, and when the work is done I’ll settle back into my true self.

How did you answer the question of what you wanted to be when you grew up?

Second, pay attention to the work you gravitate to.

pay attention to what you envy.

“Restorative niche” is Professor Little’s term for the place you go when you want to return to your true self.

Will this job allow me to spend time on in-character activities like, for example, reading, strategizing, writing, and researching? Will I have a private workspace or be subject to the constant demands of an open office plan? If the job doesn’t give me enough restorative niches, will I have enough free time on evenings and weekends to grant them to myself?

“reputational confusion,” in which he became known for being over-the-top effervescent, and the reputation fed on itself. This was the persona that others knew, so it was the persona he felt obliged to serve up.

“Emotional labor,” which is the effort we make to control and change our own emotions, is associated with stress, burnout, and even physical symptoms like an increase in cardiovascular disease.

people who suppress negative emotions tend to leak those emotions later in unexpected ways.

Big Five traits: Introversion-Extroversion; Agreeableness; Openness to Experience; Conscientiousness; and Emotional Stability.

so do introverts and extroverts; studies suggest that the former tend to be conflict-avoiders, while the latter are “confrontive copers,” at ease with an up-front, even argumentative style of disagreement.

introverts like people they meet in friendly contexts; extroverts prefer those they compete with.

Anger: The Misunderstood Emotion,

The “catharsis hypothesis”—that aggression builds up inside us until it’s healthily released—

catharsis hypothesis is a myth—

venting doesn’t soothe anger; it fuels it.

Because conflict-avoidant Emily would never “bite” or even hiss unless Greg had done something truly horrible, on some level she processes his bite to mean that she’s terribly guilty—of something, anything, who knows what? Emily’s guilt feels so intolerable that she tends to deny the validity of all of Greg’s claims—the legitimate ones along with those exaggerated by anger. This, of course, leads to a vicious cycle in which she shuts down her natural empathy and Greg feels unheard.

extroverts are sociable because their brains are good at handling competing demands on their attention—which is just what dinner-party conversation involves.

But the introvert pairs tended to focus on one or two serious subjects of conversation, while the extrovert pairs chose lighter-hearted and wider-ranging topics.

If you can, it’s best to teach your child self-coaxing skills while he’s still very young, when there’s less stigma associated with social hesitancy.

that people flourish when, in the words of psychologist Brian Little, they’re “engaged in occupations, roles or settings that are concordant with their personalities.”

kids stop learning when they feel emotionally threatened.

true self-esteem comes from competence, not the other way around.

the way we characterize our past setbacks profoundly influences how satisfied we are with our current lives.

Our culture made a virtue of living only as extroverts. We discouraged the inner journey, the quest for a center. So we lost our center and have to find it again.
