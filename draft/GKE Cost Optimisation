How much of cluster resources are used within cluster.

Efficient bin packing
Allocatable cluster resoueces vs requested resources

3 main areas to monitor resources. CPU, memory and pods per node.

Aggregate clusrter monitoring. Per cluster high level summary bin acking
Larger cluster, diverse 

Per node pool monitoring can identiy target areas were bin packing can be improved.
Under utilisation may not be a problem at aggregate cluster level.

Collect allocatable resources: total cpu/memory available
Requested reources: Recommended reousrces: recommendations from platform from likes of veritcal pod autpscaler
Used resources.
