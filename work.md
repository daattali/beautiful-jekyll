My mission is to leverage my talents and interests to do the _most_ good in the world. Naturally, I gravitated to
machine learning, which can exponentially amplify my productivity using automation. 

At the moment, I am the Lead ML Engineer at Dendra Systems, where I work on scaling up ecosystem monitoring and 
restoration using smart drones. Our moonshot plan is to scale our operations to the trillion-tree scale, which would 
be enough carbon sequestered to offset all the carbon released into the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution.

# Projects

### Tackling Climate Change Using Automated Afforestation

_[Dendra Systems](www.dendra.io) - Feb. 2020 → Now_

I am currently the Lead ML engineer at a start-up fighting climate change and deforestation using tree-planting drones.

### Improving Remote Monitoring of Cardiac Patients by Automatically Detecting Arrythmias

_[Pacemate](www.pacemate.com) - Feb. 2019 → Dec. 2019_

I worked as the lead data scientist at an implantable heart device analytics company. I implemented a pipeline to
process incoming ECG transmissions from remote devices and classify arrythmias using a deep convolutional neural
network. To train this network, I mined years of ground truth data labeled by board-certified electrophysiologists.

### Reinforcement Learning for Tracing Neuron Morphologies

_[Hanchuan Peng](https://www.alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/research/products-tools/vaa3d/)
lab. [Allen Institute for Brain Science](https://www.alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/brain-science/), Seattle, WA, USA -
Summer 2018_

I made a proof of concept showing that deep reinforcement learning can be used to automatically trace neuron
morphologies.

### Mosquito thermal plume tracking

_[Adrienne Fairhall](www.fairhalllab.com) lab. [University of Washington](uw.edu), Dept. of Physiology and Biophysics,
Seattle, WA, USA - 2014 → 2016_

I worked as a research assistant in Fairhall Lab. We're interested in answering how the history of sensory experience
affects decision-making. As a model, we use mosquitoes host-seeking behavior, as carbon dioxide and thermal signals are
known to inform their search. These thermal and olfactory cues have a complicated and sparse structure due to
turbulence. How do mosquitoes use spatially- and temporally-sparse information to navigate to hosts? With the Daniel,
Riffell and Dickinson labs, we study the behavioral and neurophysiological responses of mosquitoes to temporal patterns
in heat and CO2 plumes, which we then use to develop models for multisensory integration.

My current role in the project is creating models of mosquitoes tracking turbulent thermal plumes and benchmark those
models against wind-tunnel behavioral data. In particular, I am creating driven, damped agent-based dynamical models
which reproduce mosquito baseline flight and then test various strategies for plume navigation. These models will be
further validated using electrophysiological and tethered flight data to test theories about multi-modal decision-making.

### Humpback Whale Census

_[Kimberley Community Whale Research Project](https://kimberleycommunitywhaleresearch.wordpress.com/), Murdudun,
Australia - 2012_

A community-initiated peer-review at the proposed site of the world’s second-largest liquefied gas processing port. Our
peer-review’s estimates of humpback migration and breeding activity near James Price Point revealed gross discrepancies
in the original oil conglomerate’s survey.

### Mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease

_[Leo Pallanck](http://www.gs.washington.edu/faculty/pallanck.htm) lab. [University of Washington](uw.edu), Dept. of
Genome Sciences, Seattle, WA, USA - 2010_

I helped establish a method to grow, stain, and image primary dopaminergic neural culture from _Drosophila_ embryos in
order to test whether Parkin and PINK1, proteins involved in Parkinson’s disease, are recruited to depolarized
mitochondria in dopaminergic neurons. This research
was [published in PNAS](https://www.pnas.org/content/109/26/10438.short). I presented a poster at SACNAS 2010.

### Probing Function of Colon Cancer Proteins

_[Brooke M. McCartney](https://www.cmu.edu/bio/people/faculty/mccartney.html) lab. [Carnegie Mellon University](cmu.edu)
, Dept. of Biological Sciences, Pittsburg, PA, USA - 2009_

I determined that APC2, a protein with probable roles in colon cancer tumorogenesis, did not interact with β-catenin of
the Wnt pathway’s destruction complex. I determined that APC2’s conserved N-terminal domain was not essential for its
proper localization. This research was [published in Genetics](). I presented a poster at ABRCMS 2009 and Sigma Xi 2009.

### Quantifying endogenous sRNA concentrations in _C. elegans_

_[Katherine Walstrom](https://www.ncf.edu/directory/listing/katherine-walstrom/) lab. [New College of Florida](ncf.edu),
Dept. of Natural Sciences, Sarasota, FL, USA - 2010 → 2011_

My thesis proposes a model for RNA Helicase A function in endogenous _C. elegans_ RNAi pathways.

### Searching for P450 Active site mimics

_[Paul Scudder](https://www.ncf.edu/directory/listing/paul-scudder/) lab. [New College of Florida](ncf.edu), Dept. of
Natural Sciences, Sarasota, FL, USA - 2008 → 2009_

I partially synthesized precursors to a novel high-valent iron-stabilizing macrocycle based on the active site of
cytochrome P450.
