title: Tenure-track Instructor
---

The University of British Columbia, Vancouver invites applications for a tenure-track instructor-1 position, 
in the Department of Statistics.  The position has a primary focus on contributing to the delivery and further 
development of the [Master of Data Science](http://masterdatascience.science.ubc.ca/) (MDS) program, 
while also involving contributions to other departmental programs.  
The MDS program is a collaborative effort of the Department of Computer Science, the Department of Statistics and the Faculty of Science. 

This position provides an opportunity to pursue a career based on excellence and leadership in teaching, while participating in the intellectually exciting atmosphere of two top-tier departments jointly supporting the first comprehensive Masters of Data Science program in Canada.

The position falls within the UBC's Educational Leadership Stream, which is a career path for teaching-oriented faculty that begins with the tenure-track Instructor rank, continues with the tenured Senior Instructor rank, and culminates with the Professor of Teaching rank. This path is analogous to the research-oriented faculty progression of tenure-track Assistant Professor, tenured Associate Professor, and Full Professor rank.

The MDS program focusses on the innovative and responsible use of Data Science tools across a broad spectrum of data types and domain areas. It is a 10-month, professional graduate program, with 8 months of course modules followed by a 2-month capstone project.  The first cohort of 22 students began their studies in September 2016, with larger cohorts anticipated in subsequent years.

The successful applicant will be expected to teach within both the MDS program and other departmental programs.  He/she will also actively participate in department activities, service, events and initiatives. Specific duties of this position include:
-	Liaising with capstone project partners and mentoring student capstone teams.
-	Collaborating with module instructors to ensure coherence of the MDS program.
-	Facilitating the transfer of instructional material and techniques between MDS and other departmental programs.
-	Fostering a positive learning environment for MDS students.
-	Expanding the MDS curriculum and ensuring it remains modern. 
-	Liaising with other UBC units engaged in Data Science teaching and learning initiatives. 

Applicants should hold a PhD in Statistics or a related area and have a strong background in Data Science. The position requires a demonstrated excellence in and commitment to teaching, ability to work independently, effective communication skills, demonstrated ability to supervise the work of others, promise of educational leadership, and proven potential for creating innovative instructional environments in both the classroom and the laboratory. Experience in curriculum development, course design, and other initiatives that advance the University’s ability to excel in its teaching and learning mandate is also an asset.
Experience with, or aptitude for, the following is particularly desirable:

-	Engagement with Data Science organizations outside of the university.
-	Best practices for collaborative and reproducible scientific work.
-	Development of complex applications with R or Python.
-	GitHub development, particularly as a learning management system.

The Department of Statistics (<www.stat.ubc.ca>) is a leading centre for statistical science research in North America. 
Faculty members excel in both theory and methods research and collaborative research with domain-area scientists. 
The department is home to the [Applied Statistics and Data Science Group](http://asda.stat.ubc.ca/), which supports research both inside and outside the department. The department also hosts a vibrant graduate program and growing undergraduate programs. Recent efforts see the department emerging as a hub for innovation in statistical education.
The position is subject to final budgetary approval. 
The anticipated starting date is January 1, 2018, or possibly earlier.
Applicants should send a detailed curriculum vitae, a statement of vision for data science education, 
and a statement of teaching and training philosophy, to <Smith@science.ubc.ca>
by **April 19, 2017**. Applicants must also arrange for three confidential letters of reference to be sent directly to the same address by this date.
UBC hires on the basis of merit and is committed to employment equity. All qualified persons are encouraged to apply. We especially welcome applications from members of visible minority groups, women, Aboriginal persons, persons with disabilities, persons of minority sexual orientations and gender identities, and others with the skills and knowledge to engage productively with diverse communities. Canadians and permanent residents of Canada who successfully meet the criteria for excellence through the application and interview process will be given priority.
